Whose herds with milk , whose fields with bread , Whose flocks supply him with attire , Whose trees in summer yield him shade , In winter fire . <|endoftext|>
For tho’ from out our bourne of Time and Place The flood may bear me far, I hope to see my Pilot face to face When I have crost the bar. <|endoftext|>

Orpheus could lead the savage race ; And trees uprooted left their place , Sequacious of the lyre : But bright Cecilia raised the wonder higher : When to her organ vocal breath was given , An angel heard , and straight appear "d , Mistaking earth for heaven . <|endoftext|>
And an astonished, an inquiring smile wells up on my mouth, whether no dream deceives me, That now in you, eternally enough, My boldest wish, my only one, is fulfilled? <|endoftext|>
Happy the man, and happy he alone, He who can call today his own: He who, secure within, can say, Tomorrow do thy worst, for I have lived today.

The dark city, it sleeps in my heart With splendor and glow, with agonizingly colorful splendor: But flattering floats around you its reflection, subdued to whisper, gliding through the night. <|endoftext|>
The darkness rustles like a garment, The trees stagger at the edge of the sky. <|endoftext|>
And always walked behind me with his hidden hatchet The Dark Shape? so we wandered for a good while. <|endoftext|>

His soul stretched tight across the skies That fade behind a city block , Or trampled by insistent feet At four and five and six o"clock And short square fingers stuffing pipes , And evening newspapers , and eyes Assured of certain certainties , The conscience of a blackened street Impatient to assume the world . I am moved by fancies that are curled Around these images , and cling : The notion of some infinitely gentle Infinitely suffering thing . Wipe your hand across your mouth , and laugh ; The worlds revolve like ancient women Gathering fuel in vacant lots . <|endoftext|>
I replied with a laugh: "Your efforts are in vain, I see that you belong to the past in every respect." <|endoftext|>

Th ’ exalted Poet rais "d by this new Flame , With Vigor flys , where late he crept along , And Acts Divine , in a Diviner Song , Commits to the eternal Trompe of Fame . And thus Alexis does prove Love to be , As the Worlds Soul , the Soul of Poetry . <|endoftext|>

Let man test all things, say the heavenly ones, That he, nourished vigorously, may learn to thank for all things, And understand the freedom to set out wherever he will. <|endoftext|>
I taste a liquor never brewed , From tankards scooped in pearl ; Not all the vats upon the Rhine Yield such an alcohol ! <|endoftext|>
I think of yours when the sun shines from the sea; I think of yours when the moon's flicker paints itself in springs. <|endoftext|>
I saw you, and the gentle joy flowed from the sweet look at me; Whole was my heart at your side, And every breath for you. A pink spring weather surrounded the lovely face, And tenderness for me - you gods! I hope, I do not deserve it! <|endoftext|>
Autumn, thou shalt teach me household, to be without, to covet, And thou shalt teach me winter to die, to perish, to inherit spring. <|endoftext|>

To new songs and dances. Be eternally happy, As you love me. <|endoftext|>
Hail, Cronus! Away the rattling trot! The way glides downhill; disgusting vertigo hesitates before the forehead of your haulers. Fresh the bumpy stick, roots, stones the trot Fast into life! <|endoftext|>
Cursed tassel, who robbed me of my peace all night! He hung over my head like the sword of Damocles, so menacing! <|endoftext|>
The morning comes to consciousness Of faint stale smells of beer From the sawdust-trampled street With all its muddy feet that press To early coffee-stands . With the other masquerades That time resumes , One thinks of all the hands That are raising dingy shades In a thousand furnished rooms . <|endoftext|>
We arrived there in the evening. The planks of the Zugbrück groaned so eerily as we rolled over; the dark ditches yawned. <|endoftext|>
We continue to play. Bang and hard-to-learn reciting and repeating gestures from time to time; but your being removed from us, removed from our piece, can <|endoftext|>
When the Ancient Holy Father With a serene hand From rolling clouds Sows Blessing Lightning Over the Earth I Kiss the last hem of his garment, Childish shivers Faithfully in the breast. <|endoftext|>
