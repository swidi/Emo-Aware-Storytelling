I felt as if something had been crossed over my forehead, like a cold censor's hand, And my thoughts gave way? <|endoftext|>
Do you love a roe deer more than others, do not let it graze alone, hunters wander in the forest and blow, voices wander back and forth. <|endoftext|>
Sideways of the canopy Shade attracts thee And the refreshing gaze On the threshold of the maiden there. Refresh thyself!? Me too, maiden, That foaming drink And the friendly health gaze! <|endoftext|>

In the evening the autumnal forests sound of deadly weapons, the golden plains and blue lakes, over which the sun rolls gloom; the night embraces dying warriors, the wild lamentation of their broken mouths. But still gathers in the willow ground Red clouds, in which dwells an angry god, The shed blood, moonless coolness; All the streets flow into black decay. Under golden branches of the night and stars Shadows of the sister sway through the silent grove, To greet the spirits of the heroes, the bleeding heads; And the dark flutes of autumn sound softly in the pipe. O proud mourning! you bronze altars, The hot flame of the spirit nourishes today a mighty pain, The unborn grandchildren. <|endoftext|>
Sounds, brother-in-law, your horn, rattle the resounding trot, That the hurricane may hear: a prince cometh, and the mighty shall lift themselves up from their seats. <|endoftext|>
The soft complaining flute In dying notes discovers The woes of hopeless lovers , Whose dirge is whisper "d by the warbling lute . <|endoftext|>
‘ Forward , the Light Brigade ! ’ Was there a man dismay "d ? Not tho ’ the soldier knew Some one had blunder "d : Their "s not to make reply , Their "s not to reason why , Their "s but to do and die : Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred . <|endoftext|>
I see the Deep "s untrampled floor With green and purple seaweeds strown ; I see the waves upon the shore , Like light dissolved in star-showers , thrown : I sit upon the sands alone ,— The lightning of the noontide ocean Is flashing round me , and a tone Arises from its measured motion , How sweet ! did any heart now share in my emotion . <|endoftext|>
Till seraphs swing their snowy hats , And saints to windows run , To see the little tippler Leaning against the sun ! <|endoftext|>
If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breathe a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’ <|endoftext|>
"I love you; I am moved by your beautiful countenance; and if you are not willing, I use violence." My father, my father, now he touches me! The King of the Saviors has grieved me. <|endoftext|>
AH, how sweet it is to love! Ah, how gay is young Desire! And what pleasing pains we prove When we first approach Love"s fire! Pains of love be sweeter far Than all other pleasures are. <|endoftext|>
Woe! woe! Both parts are in a hurry! Already as servants, they are ready to rise! Help me, alas! you high powers! <|endoftext|>
Walle! walle some stretch, That, for the purpose, water may flow, And with rich, full swallow, To the bath be poured out. <|endoftext|>
All hearts are happy, all hearts are free - it sounds like a scream from the ship's room, "Fire!" was what it sounded like, a smoke from the cabin and hatch penetrated, a smoke, then flames blazing, and twenty minutes to Buffalo. <|endoftext|>
The corpse rolls out completely. The dress blows like a white ship in the wind. The dead eyes stare wide and blind at the sky, which is full of pink clouds. <|endoftext|>
Love, like spring-tides full and high, Swells in every youthful vein; But each tide does less supply, Till they quite shrink in again: If a flow in age appear, "Tis but rain, and runs not clear. <|endoftext|>
Now again the breathing step laboriously up the mountain. Up then, not sluggish then! Striving and hoping. <|endoftext|>
It has no future but itself , Its infinite realms contain Its past , enlightened to perceive New periods of pain . <|endoftext|>

She promised me faithfulness, gave me a ring, she broke the faithfulness, My little ring jumped in two. <|endoftext|>
We are Teutons, cozy and well-behaved, We sleep healthy plant sleep, And when we awake, we thirst, Yet not for the blood of our princes. <|endoftext|>
We finally came to a place where sparkling candlelight And sparkling gold and gemstone; That was the Three Kings Chapel. <|endoftext|>
Sharp violins proclaim Their jealous pangs , and desperation , Fury , frantic indignation , Depth of pains , and height of passion , For the fair , disdainful dame . <|endoftext|>
I sing and cannot weep, And spin so alone The thread clear and pure As long as the moon will shine. <|endoftext|>
The crows shrine And fly to the city: Soon it will be snowing, - Blessed is he who still has - home! <|endoftext|>
When we were together, the nightingale sang Now her sound reminds me that you drove from me. <|endoftext|>
I wander through the silent night, Since the moon creeps so secretly gently often out of the dark cloud cover, And back and forth in the valley awakens the nightingale, Then again everything gray and still. <|endoftext|>
You who are from heaven, who satisfy all joy and pain, who fill Him who is doubly miserable, doubly with refreshment; Oh, I am tired of driving! What is the point of all the torment and lust? Sweet peace, come, oh come into my breast! <|endoftext|>
Death if Death good:for <|endoftext|>
In the alleys her shoulder grasps it easily. A question. No answer. A face pales. In the distance a ringing whimperes thin And the beards tremble around her pointed chin. <|endoftext|>
As if in the garden, full of roses white and red, My beloved had to wait for me, And yet is long dead. <|endoftext|>
Just as a palm tree rises above itself, the more hail and rain attack it, so may the love in us become mighty and great, By cross, by suffering, by all kinds of distress. Change of Tharau, my riches, my wealth, Thou my soul, my flesh and my blood. <|endoftext|>
And the stately ships go on To their haven under the hill ; But O for the touch of a vanish "d hand , And the sound of a voice that is still ! <|endoftext|>
I "m nobody ! Who are you ? Are you nobody , too ? Then there ‘ s a pair of us — do n"t tell ! They ‘ d banish us , you know . <|endoftext|>
Earth has not anything to show more fair: Dull would he be of soul who could pass by A sight so touching in its majesty: This City now doth, like a garment, wear The beauty of the morning: silent, bare, Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie Open unto the fields, and to the sky; All bright and glittering in the smokeless air. Never did sun more beautifully steep In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill; Ne’er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep! The river glideth at his own sweet will: Dear God! the very houses seem asleep; And all that mighty heart is lying still! <|endoftext|>
A sudden blow: the great wings beating still Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill, He holds her helpless breast upon his breast. <|endoftext|>
Is there for honest Poverty That hings his head , an ’ a ’ that ; The coward slave — we pass him by , We dare be poor for a ’ that ! For a ’ that , an ’ a ’ that . Our toils obscure an ’ a ’ that , The rank is but the guinea "s stamp , The Man "s the gowd for a ’ that . <|endoftext|>
In the cities be only mourning, Until freedom from the walls waves the flags into the land; Until you, Rhine, thunder through free arches, let the last waves cursing crunch into the sand. <|endoftext|>
I was angry with my friend : I told my wrath , my wrath did end . I was angry with my foe : I told it not , my wrath did grow . <|endoftext|>
He approached, and with the axe he smashed the poor skeletons of superstition, he knocked you down. <|endoftext|>
Griesgrämig a thin Droschkenschimmel stares. At sharp corners their skins squeak. <|endoftext|>
As all the heavens were a bell , And Being but an ear , And I and silence some strange race , Wrecked , solitary , here . <|endoftext|>
The Magi, however, who otherwise lay there so still, O miracle! they now sat upright on their sarcophagi. <|endoftext|>
Whore who gives birth to a dead child in icy showers. God's wrath whips furiously the foreheads of the possessed, purple plague, hunger that breaks green eyes. Oh, the horrible laughter of gold. <|endoftext|>
Insulation wants to spread its wings, the trees stir eerily, clouds move like heavy dreams - what does this grey mean? <|endoftext|>
Twilight full of rest and wine; sad guitars flow. And to the mild lamp inside you return as in a dream. <|endoftext|>
Yet now despair itself is mild , Even as the winds and waters are ; I could lie down like a tired child , And weep away the life of care Which I have borne and yet must bear , Till death like sleep might steal on me , And I might feel in the warm air My cheek grow cold , and hear the sea Breathe o"er my dying brain its last monotony . <|endoftext|>
The father is horrified, he rides swiftly, He holds the groaning child in his arms, reaches the court with difficulty and difficulty; In his arms the child was dead. <|endoftext|>
Ye flowery banks o ’ bonie Doon , How can ye blume sae fair ? How can ye chant , ye little birds , And I sae fu ’ o care ! Thou "ll break my heart , thou bonie bird , That sings upon the bough ! Thou minds me o ’ the happy days When my fause Luve was true . Thou "ll break my heart , thou bonie bird , That sings beside thy mate ; For sae I sat , and sae I sang , And wist na o ’ my fate . <|endoftext|>
Fill bush and valley still with mist, finally loosen My soul completely; <|endoftext|>
Play this serious game, because time still suffers, that crown, wisdom, strength and good are an empty splendor! <|endoftext|>
The star / to which one steers the stiff sails / Is a befuddled mouth. The port / where one thinks / Is a beautiful woman. The shores are the breasts. The approach is a kiss. The purpose / sweet lusts. <|endoftext|>
Now you stand rigid, look backwards, oh, how long ago! What fool did you escape into the world before winter? <|endoftext|>
Not one of all the purple host Who took the flag to-day Can tell the definition , So clear , of victory , <|endoftext|>
Germans, believe your seers, Our days will be brass, Our future will rattle in brass; Black death is our wages only, Our gold an evening gold only, Our red a bleeding heart! <|endoftext|>
You, too, wanted more, but love forces all of us down, suffering bends more mightily, Yet Our bow does not return in vain from whence it comes. <|endoftext|>
Once upon a time there was a king in Thule, faithful to the grave, to Whom dying his lover gave a golden cup. <|endoftext|>
Surely some revelation is at hand; Surely the Second Coming is at hand. The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert A shape with lion body and the head of a man, A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds. The darkness drops again; but now I know That twenty centuries of stony sleep Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle, And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born? <|endoftext|>
My heart was beating fast on horseback; it was done almost as soon as it was thought; the evening was already rocking the earth, and the night was hanging on the mountains. Already stood in the mist the oak A giant piled up, Where darkness looked out of the bushes With a hundred black eyes. <|endoftext|>
We are as faithful as oak, also lime wood, of which we are proud; In the land of oaks and lime trees there will never be a Brutus. <|endoftext|>
Gendarmes wrapped in mortuary sheets, a white haunted tangle, surrounded my bed, I also heard eerie chain clanking. <|endoftext|>
And you O my soul where you stand , Surrounded , detached , in measureless oceans of space , Ceaselessly musing , venturing , throwing , seeking the spheres to connect them , Till the bridge you will need be form "d , till the ductile anchor hold , Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere , O my soul . <|endoftext|>
He saw him fall, drink, and sink deep into the sea. His eyes would sink, never drink a drop more. <|endoftext|>
Take up the White Man"s burden - No tawdry rule of kings, But toil of serf and sweeper - The tale of common things. The ports ye shall not enter, The roads ye shall not tread, Go make them with your living, And mark them with your dead ! <|endoftext|>
As if I were just a little flapping motor, I let my arms sprinkle, the glowing air stings as if with poisonous spikes; the sweat breaks out again and again... <|endoftext|>
The wind in the blowing pastures, By the water the wandering wind intoxicated the longing sufferings that are in the twilight. <|endoftext|>
We know nothing of this going that does not share with us. We have no reason to show admiration and love or hatred to the death that a masked mouth <|endoftext|>
It drifts past me in the sea of the city. One by one, one by one. A glance in the eye, and already over. The organ-turner turns his song. <|endoftext|>
Sighs which are from lovers blown Do but gently heave the heart: Ev"n the tears they shed alone Cure, like trickling balm, their smart: Lovers, when they lose their breath, Bleed away in easy death. <|endoftext|>
So I walk through the streets, people go here and there, I don't know what I'm doing, I'm just so happy. <|endoftext|>
What are we human beings! A dwelling house of grim pain. A ball of false happiness, a false light of this time, a scene of bitter fear, occupied with sharp suffering. Soon melted snow and burnt candles. <|endoftext|>
Your soul, which loves mine, is forfeited with her in carpet Tibet. <|endoftext|>
Death sounds of metal; And a white animal breaks down. Brown girl rough songs Are blown away in the fall of leaves. <|endoftext|>
But such a tide as moving seems asleep, Too full for sound and foam, When that which drew from out the boundless deep Turns again home. <|endoftext|>
is strictly &amp; artificial &amp; <|endoftext|>
My spirit is too weak—mortality Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep, And each imagined pinnacle and steep Of godlike hardship tells me I must die Like a sick eagle looking at the sky. Yet ‘tis a gentle luxury to weep, That I have not the cloudy winds to keep, Fresh for the opening of the morning’s eye. Such dim-conceived glories of the brain Bring round the heart an indescribable feud; So do these wonders a most dizzy pain, That mingles Grecian grandeur with the rude Wasting of old Time—with a billowy main— A sun—a shadow of a magnitude. <|endoftext|>
Where then is the colorful lust, the comfort of a friend, and the faithful breast, the sweet sight of a woman? Will no one be merry with me? <|endoftext|>
The field glows white and cold, the sky is lonely and monstrous, jackdaws circle over the pond, and hunters descend from the forest. <|endoftext|>
But if here is clouded / by blind burning smoke The sun of reason / the shipwreck also follows The destruction of the soul / And the destruction of the body: For beyde the lust of a woman kills us. <|endoftext|>
If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies, Or being hated, don’t give way to hating, And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise: <|endoftext|>
i carry your heart with me(i carry it in my heart)i am never without it(anywhere i go you go,my dear;and whatever is done by only me is your doing,my darling) i fear <|endoftext|>
As it was morning outside, a girl stood by the window, combing her long hair, wiping her eyes clear. <|endoftext|>
But oh ! what art can teach , What human voice can reach , The sacred organ "s praise ? Notes inspiring holy love , Notes that wing their heavenly ways To mend the choirs above . <|endoftext|>
We call them fathers, and fatherland let us call that land which belongs hereditarily to the princes; We also love sauerkraut with sausages. <|endoftext|>
And the moon like an old man with a humped back. <|endoftext|>
The dead woman sails out joyfully, torn by the wind and the high tide. Her thick belly carries the water large, hollowed out and almost gnawed. It roars like a grotto from the morsels. <|endoftext|>
- And how still in a thickly locked cave everyone stands far away and feels: alone <|endoftext|>
Singing birds of all kinds, sunshine plays in front of the house, outside over the beautiful garden clouds fly far out. <|endoftext|>
But my whole heart is upon you, O gray city by the sea. The magic of youth from generation to generation rests upon you, O gray city by the sea. <|endoftext|>
Save yourself in the heart of the night, quickly bury yourself in the darkness, as in honeycombs. Make yourself small, get out of your bed. <|endoftext|>
In the dark eye no tear You sit at the loom and gnash your teeth: Germany, we weave your shroud, We weave into it the threefold curse - We weave, we weave! <|endoftext|>
It is an empty boat that floats down the black channel in the evening. In the gloom of the old asylum, human ruins decay. The dead orphans lie on the garden wall. Angels with flecked wings emerge from grey rooms. Worms drip from their yellowed eyelids. The place in front of the church is dark and silent, as in the days of childhood. On silver soles, past lives glide by. And the shadows of the damned descend to the sighing waters. In his tomb, the white magician plays with his serpents. Silently above the place of the skull, God's golden eyes open. <|endoftext|>
Pain has an element of blank ; It cannot recollect When it began , or if there were A day when it was not . <|endoftext|>
In the dunes, coming, walking, gliding, pulling. In the lime play of the big wave hand. <|endoftext|>
I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless; That only men incredulous of despair, Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air Beat upward to God’s throne in loud access Of shrieking and reproach. Full desertness, In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare Of the absolute heavens. Deep-hearted man, express Grief for thy dead in silence like to death— Most like a monumental statue set In everlasting watch and moveless woe Till itself crumble to the dust beneath. Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet: If it could weep, it could arise and go. <|endoftext|>
And the King beckons again, Then the double-opened house spews out Two leopards at once, They rush with courageous desire to fight On the tiger, That grabs them with his grim paws, And the Leu with roar straightens up, there it becomes quiet, And around in circles, Hot of murder, Camp the horrible cats. <|endoftext|>
The draught grows, but the cloud of smoke stands, the captain peeks behind the steering wheel, he no longer sees his helmsman, but through the mouthpiece he asks: "Still there, John Maynard?" "Yes, sir. I am." <|endoftext|>
The devil's necks grow like giraffes. The child has no head. The mother holds it in front of her. Frog fingers gape in her back when she falls backwards. <|endoftext|>
He did not care, He emptied him of every feast; His eyes went over him as often as he drank from it. <|endoftext|>
There falls a star! And our wish to him, startled, urgently connected: What has begun, and what has passed away? What is in debt? And what is forgiven? <|endoftext|>
The crows shrine and fly to the city: Soon it will be snowing, - Woe to him who has no home! <|endoftext|>
Sing a song as sweetly as the springs on the pebbles, as the bees buzz around the lime tree, murmur, whisper, trickle. <|endoftext|>
Whilst skies are blue and bright , Whilst flowers are gay , Whilst eyes that change ere night Make glad the day ; Whilst yet the calm hours creep , Dream thou — and from thy sleep Then wake to weep . <|endoftext|>
Do you know the flower that sprouted in the moonlit ground? Out of the bud, half-opened, young limbs blossoming, White arms, red mouth, And the nightingales beat, And all around it begins to lament, Oh deathly wounded with love, Of sunken beautiful days? Come, oh come to the silent ground! <|endoftext|>
Everything is open to joy, All hearts are happy, And the old parents hope, And the sister is adorned. I alone must mourn lonely, For sweet delusion flees me, And winged upon these walls I behold destruction. <|endoftext|>
The poles protrude from the gray rampart like a burnt forest into the early red, As black as slag. Where the water is dead To store the rotten and decaying. <|endoftext|>
In the sky, however, the moon was hereditary, It became more and more cloudy. Like black horses, the wild clouds chased past it. <|endoftext|>
When landlords turn the drunken bee Out of the foxglove "s door , When butterflies renounce their drams , I shall but drink the more ! <|endoftext|>
She looked at me; her life hung in the balance. <|endoftext|>
I hear a little deer rustling through the forest, I hear my love lament, The love rustles so soon. <|endoftext|>
? Great is the deceit and cunning of men. My heart is broken with pain. Well, the French horn is wandering here and there, O flee! You do not know who I am. <|endoftext|>
In all the bridges, below us the Zille grows as in drums in silence. <|endoftext|>
My heart, my heart is sad, but May shines merrily; I stand, leaning on the linden tree, high on the old bastion. <|endoftext|>
His thatched roof, where the pigeons sunbathe, and play and jump, beckons to him sweet rest, As to the townspeople the gold hall, As the cushion of the townspeople. <|endoftext|>
You have recruited a maiden In violet and clover, So I stand here alone, Do my heart hurt. <|endoftext|>
And on the horses they pass by, even girls, bright ones, almost outgrown by this horse jump; in the middle of the swing they look up, somewhere, over - And now and then a white elephant. <|endoftext|>
Fly, bird, snore your song in the sound of a desert bird! - Hide, you fool, your bleeding heart in ice and mockery! <|endoftext|>
A silence dwells in black tops. A light of fire scurries from the huts. Sometimes a sleigh rings very far away And slowly the grey moon rises. <|endoftext|>
Soldier! Soldier! So step by step. Hear Germany, how she fought and suffered! Hear Germany, how she draws eternally, The best blood, into the heroic song! <|endoftext|>
Sometimes I dipped my fingers in it, and sometimes it happened that I painted the doorposts with the blood in passing. <|endoftext|>
Alas ! I have nor hope nor health , Nor peace within nor calm around , Nor that content surpassing wealth The sage in meditation found , And walked with inward glory crowned — Nor fame , nor power , nor love , nor leisure . Others I see whom these surround — Smiling they live , and call life pleasure ;— To me that cup has been dealt in another measure . <|endoftext|>
Continuous as the stars that shine And twinkle on the milky way, They stretched in never-ending line Along the margin of a bay: Ten thousand saw I at a glance, Tossing their heads in sprightly dance. <|endoftext|>
A curse to God, to whom we prayed In winter coldness and famine; We have hoped and waited in vain, He has apprehended us and fed us and fooled us - We weave, we weave! <|endoftext|>
Stand! stand! for we have measured Your gifts!? Ah, I perceive! Woe! woe! I have forgotten the word! <|endoftext|>
The air went through the fields, The ears of corn gently billowed, The woods rustled softly, So starry was the night. <|endoftext|>
And when they all were seated , A service like a drum Kept beating , beating , till I thought My mind was going numb . <|endoftext|>
They shut the road through the woods Seventy years ago. Weather and rain have undone it again, And now you would never know There was once a road through the woods Before they planted the trees. It is underneath the coppice and heath, And the thin anemones. Only the keeper sees That, where the ring-dove broods, And the badgers roll at ease, There was once a road through the woods. <|endoftext|>
Tyger , tyger , burning bright In the forests of the night , What immortal hand or eye Dare frame thy fearful symmetry ? <|endoftext|>
"Here rests John Maynard! In smoke and fire he held the steering wheel firmly in his hand, he saved us, he wears the crown, he died for us, our love his reward. John Maynard." <|endoftext|>
I wandered lonely as a Cloud That floats on high over Vales and Hills , When all at once I saw a crowd A host of dancing Daffodills ; Along the Lake , beneath the trees , Ten thousand dancing in the breeze . <|endoftext|>
O man! Where are you? Like a beetle iron armor you in closing tangle. <|endoftext|>
I do not know what it means that I am so sad; A fairy tale from ancient times, that does not come out of my mind. <|endoftext|>
And my soul spread forth her wings; she flew through the quiet lands, as if she were flying home. <|endoftext|>
Two steamers came with bands. They cut the chimney at the bridge arch. Smoke, soot, stench lay on the filthy waves of the tanneries with the brown skins. <|endoftext|>
Do not give way to happiness, do not give way to envy, do not take pleasure in yourself, and do not take heed of sorrow. Happiness, place, and time have conspired against you. <|endoftext|>
Blossoms from every branch and a thousand voices from the bush <|endoftext|>
She drifts into the sea. You salute Neptune From a wreck, as she devours the sea, In which she sinks to the green depths, To rest in the arms of the feisty octopus. <|endoftext|>
I found her in the spring shade; she didn't feel it, and slumbered. <|endoftext|>
As often as the moon may shine, I think I am yours alone. My heart is clear and pure, may God unite us. <|endoftext|>
Heaven, great, full of splendid behaviour, a store of space, an abundance of world. And we, too far away for configuration, too near for turning away. <|endoftext|>
Under Turkish lime trees that bloom, on the edges of lawns, in stands swayed softly by their homesickness, the macaws breathe and know about their countries, which, even if they do not look, do not change. <|endoftext|>
Put one foot on a square, kneel the other on a tower, raise them up where the rain falls black, blowing panpipes into the storm of clouds. <|endoftext|>
What the hammer ? what the chain ? In what furnace was thy brain ? What the anvil ? what dread grasp Dare its deadly terrors clasp ? <|endoftext|>
Always with the ornaments of the brides, I crown my fragrant hair, Ever since I consecrated myself to your service at the sad altar. My youth was but weeping, And I knew only the pain, Every bitter distress of My beating to my sensitive heart. <|endoftext|>
And they rebuke my lamentations, And they reproach my sorrow. Lonely in the wilderness must I carry my tormented heart, Shunned by the happy, And derided by the joyful! Thou hast given me a heavy burden, O Pythian, thou wicked God. <|endoftext|>
If he stands with firm, marrow-like bones on the well-established Permanent Earth, he will not be able to compare Himself only with the oak or the vine. <|endoftext|>
The trumpet "s loud clangour Excites us to arms , With shrill notes of anger , And mortal alarms . The double double double beat Of the thundering drum Cries , hark ! the foes come ; Charge , charge ! " tis too late to retreat . <|endoftext|>
The future merry cavalry shall dwell here in the Dome, And if ye will not give way willingly, I will use violence And let you lurk with butts! <|endoftext|>
John Anderson , my jo , John , When we were first acquent ; Your locks were like the raven , Your bonie brow was brent ; But now your brow is beld , John , Your locks are like the snaw ; But blessings on your frosty pow , John Anderson , my jo . <|endoftext|>
Nor dread nor hope attend A dying animal; A man awaits his end Dreading and hoping all; Many times he died, Many times rose again, A great man in his pride Confronting murderous men Casts derision upon Supersession of breath; He knows death to the bone – Man has created death. <|endoftext|>
Spring clouds rise over the gloomy city, which is silent of the monks of nobler times. <|endoftext|>
When your lips are silent, your eyes and your tears must show how love never rests. <|endoftext|>
Before freedom be no peace, be no wife to man, and no golden grain to the field; Before freedom, before victory, see no infant from the cradle of joyful gaze into the world! <|endoftext|>
Drunk with the last ray tear me away, a sea of fire in the foaming eye, blinded me, staggering in hell at night gate. <|endoftext|>
Darkness must conceal deeply all woe, all lust; but the moon and the stars show what dwells in my breast. <|endoftext|>
But most , through midnight streets I hear How the youthful harlot "s curse Blasts the new-born infant "s tear , And blights with plagues the marriage-hearse . <|endoftext|>
Let rustle, dear, let rustle, I do not know how I will feel, The streams always rustle, And none goes astray. <|endoftext|>
And then a Plank in Reason, broke, And I dropped down, and down - And hit a World, at every plunge, And Finished knowing - then - <|endoftext|>
The stars spread white sadness. In the grey, filled with deception and ringing, behold how the terrible are scattered in confusion. <|endoftext|>
And behind me walked again My black, masked companion. I was so tired, my knees broke, But we always went on. <|endoftext|>
Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art— Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night And watching, with eternal lids apart, Like nature’s patient, sleepless Eremite, The moving waters at their priestlike task Of pure ablution round earth’s human shores, Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask Of snow upon the mountains and the moors— No—yet still stedfast, still unchangeable, Pillow’d upon my fair love’s ripening breast, To feel for ever its soft fall and swell, Awake for ever in a sweet unrest, Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath, And so live ever—or else swoon to death. <|endoftext|>
Like jumpers, they moved the longest-dead bones; they smelled of modernists and at the same time of incense. <|endoftext|>
The life of this world is already hastening to kiss the world, And sticks its head up; one sees the splendor of the rays Now twinkling on the sea. Oh thrice supreme power! Enlighten him who now bows before your feet! <|endoftext|>
The merchant takes what his storehouses hold, The abbot chooses the noble firn, The king closes the bridges and the streets, And said, The tithe is mine. <|endoftext|>
All the bells go; their tones swell skyward from churches and chapels, a ringing and ringing, otherwise the city is silent, a service only it has today: ten thousand follow or more, and no eye in the course, the tears empty. <|endoftext|>
One gets up. He hangs a black larva in front of the white moon. Night, which descends like lead from the dark sky, pushes the houses deep into the shaft of darkness. <|endoftext|>
The flowing rushing water intoxicated the voices of dreams, the paler and paler blurred in the floating mist. <|endoftext|>

When our father goes for a walk, we take our hat off with piety; Germany, the pious nursery, is not a Roman murder pit. <|endoftext|>
As we march - step by step - in our blood, all the fathers, all the grandchildren, march with us: in the eternal pulse of the nation. <|endoftext|>
And joy and delight from every breast. O earth, O sun, O happiness, O lust, <|endoftext|>
Three little people playing blind cow? The afternoon, a gently weeping god. <|endoftext|>
If you swell furiously in the winter night or swell around the spring language of young buds. <|endoftext|>
The cheeks turn pale, the bright eyes are like the light of burnt candles. The soul is stormed, like the sea in March. What is this life, what are we, me and you? <|endoftext|>
In the water. Black food vapours smoulder And are to be looked at like aquatic plants. The lives, which accumulate at the very bottom, begin to tell gently from the sky, <|endoftext|>
There is now so silence in the world, clouds draw lonely over the field, And field and tree discuss? O son of man, what shudders thee? <|endoftext|>
Blessed do I praise Polyxenes In the drunken delusion of the heart, For the best of the Hellenes she hopes to embrace bridegroom. Pride is lifted up her breast, Her bliss can hardly contain her, Not you, Heavenly ones up there, Envy her in her dream. <|endoftext|>
How I often yearn for the sweetness of the patriotic feeling, When I lay on hard mattresses, In the sleepless night of exile! <|endoftext|>
I would rather fight my way through suffering, that is, endure so many joys of life. All the inclination from the heart to the heart, oh, how self-inflicted that creates pain! <|endoftext|>
We sleep as Brutus slept - but he awoke and pierced the cold knife deep into Caesar's chest! The Romans were tyrant eaters. <|endoftext|>
You tossed a blanket from the bed , You lay upon your back , and waited ; You dozed , and watched the night revealing The thousand sordid images Of which your soul was constituted ; They flickered against the ceiling . And when all the world came back And the light crept up between the shutters , And you heard the sparrows in the gutters , You had such a vision of the street As the street hardly understands ; Sitting along the bed "s edge , where You curled the papers from your hair , Or clasped the yellow soles of feet In the palms of both soiled hands . <|endoftext|>
Some might lament that I were cold , As I , when this sweet day is gone , Which my lost heart , too soon grown old , Insults with this untimely moan ; They might lament — for I am one Whom men love not ,— and yet regret , Unlike this day , which , when the sun Shall on its stainless glory set , Will linger , though enjoyed , like joy in memory yet . <|endoftext|>
Arise, awake, over the mountain and the river to meet the dawn, the last kiss to the faithful wife, And then to the faithful rapier! Until our hand is reduced to ashes, shall she not let go of the sword; We have loved long enough, And will at last hate! <|endoftext|>
The storm is here, the wild seas are hopping ashore to crush thick dams. Most people have a cold. Railways are falling off bridges. <|endoftext|>
Behold, there he comes again sluggishly. As I throw myself at you, Like, O goblin, you lie down. Crashing hits the smooth sharpness. Verily, well hit! Behold, he is divided! And now I can hope, And I breathe freely! <|endoftext|>
Lonely he often walks, full of thoughts of death, Through the graves of the village, dissects himself on a grave, And beholds the crosses, And the waving wreath of death. <|endoftext|>
He plays with his shotgun, which sparkles in the sunshine, He presents and shoulders - I want him to shoot me dead. <|endoftext|>
Unhappy Wretch , who first found out the Oar , What kind of Vengeance rests for thee in store ? If Nebats Son , that Israel led astray , Meet a severe Reward at the last Day ? Some strange unheard-of Judgement thou wilt find , Who thus hast caus "d to Sin all Humane Kind . <|endoftext|>
Virtue , how frail it is ! Friendship how rare ! Love , how it sells poor bliss For proud despair ! But we , though soon they fall , Survive their joy , and all Which ours we call . <|endoftext|>
since feeling is first who pays any attention to the syntax of things will never wholly kiss you; wholly to be a fool while Spring is in the world <|endoftext|>
NOW the bright morning-star, Day’s harbinger, Comes dancing from the East, and leads with her The flowery May, who from her green lap throws The yellow cowslip and the pale primrose. Hail, bounteous May, that dost inspire Mirth, and youth, and warm desire! Woods and groves are of thy dressing; Hill and dale doth boast thy blessing. Thus we salute thee with our early song, And welcome thee, and wish thee long. <|endoftext|>
We are not Romans, we smoke tobacco. Every people has its taste, every people has its size. In Swabia, one cooks the best dumplings. <|endoftext|>
What takes your breath must escape with the air; what do I say? we pass away like smoke from strong winds. <|endoftext|>
First because he was a dead man, and secondly because he was a king, and thirdly because he was a saviour? None of this moved me much. <|endoftext|>
A fat boy is playing with a pond. The wind has caught in a tree. The sky looks dim and pale, as if he had run out of make-up. <|endoftext|>
Saw a little boy? a little horse standing, little horse on the heath, Was so young and beautiful in the morning, He ran quickly to see it close, Saw it with many joys. Little horse, little horse, red horse, little horse on the heath. <|endoftext|>
With a roof and its shade, the stock of colorful horses rotates for a little while, all from the country that hesitates long before it goes down. Although some are hooked on chariots, all have courage in their faces; an evil red lion walks with them and every now and then a white elephant. <|endoftext|>
I met a traveller from an antique land Who said : Two vast and trunkless legs of stone Stand in the desert ... Near them , on the sand , Half sunk , a shattered visage lies , whose frown , And wrinkled lip , and sneer of cold command , Tell that its sculptor well those passions read Which yet survive , stamped on these lifeless things , The hand that mocked them , and the heart that fed : And on the pedestal these words appear : ‘ My name is Ozymandias , king of kings : Look on my works , ye Mighty , and despair ! ’ Nothing beside remains . Round the decay Of that colossal wreck , boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away . <|endoftext|>
Let all that grieves you and refreshes you be chosen; accept your doom. Let all things be unrepentant. Do what must be done, and before you are commanded. Whatever you can hope for, it will always be born. <|endoftext|>
A heart / out of which nothing but my ruin quilts Zwey hands / whose wrath cast a spell on me <|endoftext|>
In the cool wind the whirring of the dying still freezes, as in the gates of the East a pale glow appears, a green glow, The thin band of the fleeting aurora <|endoftext|>
O girl, girl, how I love you! How your eye flashes, how you love me! <|endoftext|>
In the evening noise of the cities it falls far, frost and shadow of a strange darkness, And the markets round vortex falters to ice. It becomes quiet. They look around. And no one knows. <|endoftext|>
I see a torch glowing, But not in Hymen's hand; I see the clouds going, But not like a sacrificial burn. I see festivals preparing joyfully, But in the foreboding spirit I already hear the steps of the God Who tears them apart pitifully. <|endoftext|>
Far, high, glorious the view into life; From birth to birth, over the eternal spirit of eternal life. <|endoftext|>
At the old grey towers A sign house stands; A red-skinned lad goes up and down there. <|endoftext|>
My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky: So was it when my life began; So is it now I am a man; So be it when I shall grow old, Or let me die! The Child is father of the Man; And I could wish my days to be Bound each to each by natural piety. <|endoftext|>
Through the bushes winding stars eyes dive blaken sink whispers rippling blossoms hear scents splash showers rush winds rapid bounce swell cloths tear traps frightens into deep night. <|endoftext|>
I traveled with Extrapost, and drew free breath only out in the great outdoors, on bended ground. <|endoftext|>
Then let us pray that come it may , ( As come it will for a ’ that ,) That Sense and Worth , o"er a ’ the earth , Shall bear the gree , an ’ a ’ that . For a ’ that , an ’ a ’ that , It "s coming yet for a ’ that , That Man to Man , the world o"er , Shall brothers be for a ’ that . <|endoftext|>
Get out, you weary spirit; get out, we are in the land; and let go of anguish, and of bitter pain, and of grievous pain. <|endoftext|>
Success is counted sweetest By those who ne"er succeed . To comprehend a nectar Requires sorest need . <|endoftext|>
Ade, cursed world. You sea full of rough storms: And keep protection and peace, you eternal castle! <|endoftext|>
And I watered it in fears Night and morning with my tears , And I sunned it with smiles And with soft deceitful wiles . <|endoftext|>
That which has hands hurries to arrange itself. It was busy, young and old. The farmer reached for the fruits of the field, The junkie birdied through the forest. <|endoftext|>
We let go and drifted in the canal Sahn we the giant vents night fanale. <|endoftext|>
Break , break , break , On thy cold gray stones , O Sea ! And I would that my tongue could utter The thoughts that arise in me . <|endoftext|>

The way in the twilight pangs, He led to no goal, Yet he was good to go In the rain that fell trickling. <|endoftext|>
Sunset and evening star, And one clear call for me! And may there be no moaning of the bar, When I put out to sea, <|endoftext|>
For oft when on my couch I lie In vacant or in pensive mood , They flash upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude , And then my heart with pleasure fills , And dances with the Daffodils . <|endoftext|>
Cannon to right of them , Cannon to left of them , Cannon behind them Volley "d and thunder "d ; Storm "d at with shot and shell , While horse and hero fell , They that had fought so well Came thro ’ the jaws of Death , Back from the mouth of Hell , All that was left of them , Left of six hundred . <|endoftext|>
Once again the wire rope pulls with screeching terrain, inside the sulphur swamp goes out. <|endoftext|>
A mist and a brook, a frost, a dew, a shadow; As a dream mixed with bitter anguish. <|endoftext|>
But silent bleeds in dark cave dumb mankind, Adds the redeeming head of hard metals. <|endoftext|>
The sun is warm , the sky is clear , The waves are dancing fast and bright , Blue isles and snowy mountains wear The purple noon "s transparent might , The breath of the moist earth is light , Around its unexpanded buds ; Like many a voice of one delight , The winds , the birds , the ocean floods , The City "s voice itself , is soft like Solitude "s . <|endoftext|>
So I spoke, and I turned round, and I saw the terrible blinking of the mute companion's terrible hatchet, and he understood my beckoning. <|endoftext|>
O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells; Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills, For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding, For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning; Here Captain! dear father! This arm beneath your head! It is some dream that on the deck, You’ve fallen cold and dead. <|endoftext|>
But the demons grow gigantic. Their temple horn tears the sky red. Earthquakes thunder through the cities lap Around their hoof, the fire overburns. <|endoftext|>
Shameless mockingbirds scurry, mournful shadows cower on the walls. <|endoftext|>
A curse to the false fatherland, We only prosper ignominy and shame, Where every flower is kinked early, Where rottenness and rottenness refreshes the worm - We weave, we weave! <|endoftext|>
A hair so bold in spite of the Berenice speaks A mouth / that carries roses and pearls A tongue / such a giff in front of a thousand hearts carries two breasts / where rubin breaks through alabaster <|endoftext|>
But I still walk in the evening field, Only joined to the sinking star; Drink, O eyes, what holds the eyelashes, Of the golden abundance of the world! <|endoftext|>
<unk> speaks to Zeus, <unk> the world is gone, autumn, hunting, the market is no longer mine. Do you want to live in my heaven with me - as often as you come, it should be open to you. <|endoftext|>
Oh! The ghosts dragged me away, And I found myself at last on a steep rock wall; There I was bound. <|endoftext|>
They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens , And along the trampled edges of the street I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids Sprouting despondently at area gates . <|endoftext|>
People run across the asphalt, ants busily, like lizards nimble. Forehead and hands, blinking with thoughts, swimming like sunlight through dark forest. <|endoftext|>

And with astonishment and horror the knights and noblewomen see, And calmly he brings back the glove. Then his praise resounds from every mouth, But with a tender look of love? He promises him his near happiness? Receives him Miss Kunigunde. And he throws the glove in her face: <unk> The thanks, lady, I do not desire <unk>, And leaves her at the same hour. <|endoftext|>
and before thou goest forth, go back into thyself. To him is the wide world and all things subject. <|endoftext|>
And with a thousand red caps, the dark plains are strewn with flickering light, And what swarms in the streets below, He sweeps into the heaps of fire, that the flame may burn more. <|endoftext|>
Since falls from the edge of the Altans A glove of beautiful hand Between the tiger and the Leun in the middle. <|endoftext|>
Yet, if you enter the woods Of a summer evening late, When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools Where the otter whistles his mate, (They fear not men in the woods, Because they see so few.) You will hear the beat of a horse’s feet, And the swish of a skirt in the dew, Steadily cantering through The misty solitudes, As though they perfectly knew The old lost road through the woods. But there is no road through the woods. <|endoftext|>
Silence of the people loud lust: Rushes the earth as in dreams Wonderful with all the trees, What the heart barely aware, Ancient times, lime mourning, And there wander quietly showers weather-shining through the chest. <|endoftext|>
And by a sweet poisons the soul itself enveloped has deprived me of my wit and my joy. <|endoftext|>
Step forward and let them buzz, Soon it is bedtime, lest we get lost in this solitude. <|endoftext|>
A shudder in the loins engenders there The broken wall, the burning roof and tower And Agamemnon dead. Being so caught up, So mastered by the brute blood of the air, Did she put on his knowledge with his power Before the indifferent beak could let her drop? <|endoftext|>
Every shady shrub is to him a holy temple, where his God wanders closer to him; every lawn an altar, where he kneels before the sublime. <|endoftext|>
The sound of the blows reverberated from all the vaults, terrible!? Streams of blood poured out of my chest, and I awoke suddenly. <|endoftext|>
She is my life, my wealth and my money. Ännchen von Tharau has again turned her heart to me, in love and in pain Ännchen von Tharau, my wealth, my wealth, you my soul, my flesh and my blood. <|endoftext|>
Methinks I the Advent"rous Merchant see , Ploughing the faithless Seas , in search of thee , His dearest Wife and Children left behind , ( His real Wealth ) while he , a Slave to th ’ Wind , Sometimes becalm "d , the Shore with longing Eyes Wishes to see , and what he wishes , Spies : For a rude Tempest wakes him from his Dream , And Strands his Bark by a more sad Extream . Thus , hopless Wretch , is his whole Life-time spent , And though thrice Wreck"t , ‘ s no Wiser than he went . <|endoftext|>
And the lad said, I will break thee, little horse upon the heathen. And the little horse said, I will sting thee, that thou mayest remember me for ever, and I will not suffer: little horse, little horse, red horse, little horse upon the heathen. <|endoftext|>
We have thirty-six Lord (Is not too much!), and each one carries a star protectively on his heart, And he need not fear the Ides of March. <|endoftext|>

Spring shall delight and enchant me with sweet looks, summer shall entertain me with fruit and myrtle kingdom, gird me with joy. <|endoftext|>
Just as a vain dream easily falls out of sight, so must our name, praise, honor, and glory disappear. <|endoftext|>
Sitting in the trams tightly hooked into each other, the two facades people, their close looks bathe in each other, questioned without shyness. <|endoftext|>
I see joyfully the companions, everything around me lives and loves feelings of pleasure in my youth, but my heart is clouded. To me the Lenz appears in vain, Who adorns the earth festively; Who delights in life, Who looks into its depths! <|endoftext|>
They cannot scare me with their empty spaces Between stars--on stars where no human race is. I have it in me so much nearer home To scare myself with my own desert places. <|endoftext|>
O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done, The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won, The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting, While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring; But O heart! heart! heart! O the bleeding drops of red, Where on the deck my Captain lies, Fallen cold and dead. <|endoftext|>
Thus let me live , unseen , unknown , Thus unlamented let me die , Steal from the world , and not a stone Tell where I lie . <|endoftext|>
There is a weeping in the world, as if the dear God had died, And the leaden shadow that falls down weighs heavily on the grave. <|endoftext|>
Stranger in the busy green like a parade, they adorn themselves and feel too sorry for themselves, and with the precious beaks of jasper and jade they chew grey, throw it away, find it bland. <|endoftext|>
Snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast In a field I looked into going past, And the ground almost covered smooth in snow, But a few weeds and stubble showing last. <|endoftext|>
To the snow, to the rain, to the wind, in the steam of the gorges, through the scents of mist, always to! Always to! Without rest and rest! <|endoftext|>
We are the same in the flesh, but not of the same state: until death makes us the same after we have been robbed of our jewellery. <|endoftext|>
The air is cool and it is dark, And the Rhine flows calmly; The summit of the mountain sparkles in the evening sunshine. <|endoftext|>
The expense of spirit in a waste of shame Is lust in action : and till action , lust Is perjur "d , murderous , bloody , full of blame , Savage , extreme , rude , cruel , not to trust ; Enjoy "d no sooner but despised straight ; Past reason hunted ; and no sooner had , Past reason hated , as a swallow "d bait , On purpose laid to make the taker mad : Mad in pursuit and in possession so ; Had , having , and in quest , to have extreme ; A bliss in proof ,— and prov "d , a very woe ; Before , a joy propos "d ; behind a dream . All this the world well knows ; yet none knows well To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell . <|endoftext|>
Blest , who can unconcern"dly find Hours , days , and years slide soft away , In health of body , peace of mind , Quiet by day , <|endoftext|>
How - shall I flee? Move into the woods? All in vain! Crown of life, happiness without rest, love, you are! <|endoftext|>
Around a carcass that they smell somewhere, And suddenly they direct the flight to the north And vanish like a corpse In the air that trembles with lust. <|endoftext|>
But Love these Thoughts , like Mists , did soon disperse , Enlarg "d his Fancy , and set free his Muse , Biding him more Illustrious Subjects choose ; The Acts of Gods , and God-like Men reherse . From thence new Raptures did his Breast inspire , His scarce Warm-Heart converted was to Fire . <|endoftext|>
Its long shadow sways in the sea of houses and extinguishes rows of lights in the streets. It crawls heavy like fog on the pavement and slowly gropes forward house by house. <|endoftext|>
And fresh food, new blood suck? I from a free world; How is nature so good and gentle, Who holds me by the bosom! The wave cradles our barge at the stroke of a rudder, And mountains, cloudy sky, Meet our course. <|endoftext|>
Is it good to lift the veil, Where the near terror threatens? Only error is life, And knowledge is death. Take, O take away the sad clarity, the blood-stained appearance from My eye! Terrible it is to be a mortal vessel of your truth. <|endoftext|>
Let the world "s sharpness , like a clasping knife , Shut in upon itself and do no harm In this close hand of Love , now soft and warm , And let us hear no sound of human strife After the click of the shutting . Life to life — I lean upon thee , Dear , without alarm , And feel as safe as guarded by a charm Against the stab of worldlings , who if rife Are weak to injure . Very-whitely still The lilies of our lives may reassure Their blossoms from their roots , accessible Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer Growing straight , out of man "s reach , on the hill . God only , who made us rich , can make us poor . <|endoftext|>
Down there flows the blue moat in quiet rest; A boy rides in a barge, And fishes and whistles to it. <|endoftext|>

The eternal multitude now wants to close its light; Diana stands pale; the dawn laughs at the grey sky, the gentle wind awakens, and excites the feathers to greet the new day. <|endoftext|>
Tarred barrels rolled from the thresholds of dark barges on high barges. Tugs pulled on. A smoke mane hung sooty on oily waves. <|endoftext|>
If you were to be separated from me, you would live where the sun is hardly known: I will follow you, through forests, through the sea, through ice, through iron, through enemy armies. Changes of Tharau, my 'sun, my glow, my life I close into yours. <|endoftext|>
My blindness give me again And the joyful dark sense! I never sang joyful songs, Since I am your voice. You have given me the future, But you took the moment, Took the hour joyfully life - Take back your false gift! <|endoftext|>
Softly blue sky, mild roses weave Summer time through masses of leaves. He does not see them; the time in which he lives is old, withered, long since abandoned by all. <|endoftext|>

Minden is a strong castle, has good weir and weapons! However, I do not like to create anything with Prussian fortresses. <|endoftext|>

We went on. My heart in my chest was gaping open, and out of the wound of my heart the red drops glided. <|endoftext|>
How dreary to be somebody ! How public , like a frog To tell your name the livelong day To an admiring bog ! <|endoftext|>
When the sunset kisses the groves with the farewell flames, When in the glorious morning light the sun greets larks, <|endoftext|>
I walked along the pillars for a long time, and heard only the footsteps of my companion, who followed me every step of the way. <|endoftext|>
Then he admires you, God, in the morning corridor, in the rising splendour of your messenger, the glorious sun, you in the worm, and in the bud branch. <|endoftext|>
Flash "d all their sabres bare , Flash "d as they turn "d in air , Sabring the gunners there , Charging an army , while All the world wonder "d : Plunged in the battery-smoke Right thro ’ the line they broke ; Cossack and Russian Reel "d from the sabre-stroke Shatter "d and sunder "d . Then they rode back , but not Not the six hundred . <|endoftext|>
My ego is gone. It makes the starry journey. It is not I from which the clothes shine. Days die away, the white old men. Selfless nerves are full of fear and cry. <|endoftext|>
O marvellous song of the night: From afar in the land of the rivers aisle, quiet showers in the dark trees - Confuse the thoughts to me, My crazy singing here is like a call only from dreams. <|endoftext|>
The city's shoulders crack, and a roof bursts, and a red fire bursts out of it. They sit wide-legged on its ridge, and shrine like cats to the firmament. <|endoftext|>
A fat man is glued to a window. A young man wants to visit a soft woman. A grey clown puts on his boots. A pram screams and dogs curse. <|endoftext|>
Oh then I throw songs of exultation into the praise of nature, echo speaks the tones again, everything only praises the Ewgen. <|endoftext|>
This and more than this must finally perish / Because nature made it of diamond. <|endoftext|>
For never, like mortal masters, have you Celestials, All-Sustainers, that I should know, guided Me cautiously along the level path. <|endoftext|>
Such life was immersed in dreams, so I live to contemplate dreams eternally, Can despise all other pleasures, Because only the night breathes such sweet balm. <|endoftext|>
But, alas, with the morning sun, the farewell narrows my heart In your kisses what bliss! In your eye what pain! I went and you stood and looked at the earth and looked after me with a wet look: And yet what happiness to be loved! And love, gods, what happiness! <|endoftext|>
My son, why do you hide your face so anxiously? Do you not see the king of the alder? The king of the alder with crown and tail? My son, it is a mist. <|endoftext|>
They let the coffin down in flowers, they close the tomb with flowers, and with golden writing in the marble stone the city inscribes its thanks: <|endoftext|>

In the courtyard, bewitched by milky twilight, soft sick glide through autumn tanned. Her waxy-round gaze reflects golden times, filled with reverie and rest and wine. <|endoftext|>
And she stretches into the morning, as if she were still sleepy, Oh, she was so full of sorrow, braiding her hair and singing: <|endoftext|>
I felt a funeral in my brain , And mourners , to and fro , Kept treading , treading , till it seemed That sense was breaking through . <|endoftext|>
From all corners of the earth, fear shrieks, life whips, death gaspes, the heavens shreds. Blind woman slaughters wildly for horror. <|endoftext|>
Come, we want to hide closer? Like in coffins. <|endoftext|>
Even a deer is there, just like in the forest, a little blue girl strapped on. <|endoftext|>
You! We want to kiss deeply - from which we must die. <|endoftext|>
Something wants over the bridges, The stars frightened so white. <|endoftext|>
we thank thee god almighty for dying (forgive us,o life!the sin of Death <|endoftext|>
And now come, you old broom! Take the bad rags. Have been a servant for a long time: Now do my will. Stand on two legs, above be a head, hurry now and go with the pot of water. <|endoftext|>
Rest in the blowing grass, when the coolness pours out, Or pour out the spring over the flowers; Drink the breath of the blossom, Drink the gentleness of the evening air. <|endoftext|>
It is a light which the wind has extinguished. It is a heather jug which a drunk leaves in the afternoon. It is a vineyard, burnt and black with holes full of spiders. It is a room which they have whitewashed with milk. The madman has died. It is an island of the South Sea to receive The Sun God. One stirs the drums. The men perform martial dances. The women cradle their hips in creepers and fireflowers, When the sea sings. O our lost paradise. <|endoftext|>
The glimmers of the moon fly, As if I saw the castle lying beneath me in the valley, And yet it is so far from here! <|endoftext|>
The ship burst, the fire vanishes, everyone is saved, only one is missing! <|endoftext|>
Sea waves resound loudly, In the woods dwells many a sound; And we should not sing, Since joy everywhere? <|endoftext|>
I see thee when the dust lifts in the far way; In the deep night, when the walker trembles on the narrow walkway. <|endoftext|>
On the mountains he begins to dance. And he cries out, All of you warriors, up and on. And when he waves his black head, a loud chain hangs from a thousand skulls. <|endoftext|>
If I when my wife is sleeping and the baby and Kathleen are sleeping and the sun is a flame-white disc in silken mists above shining trees ,— if I in my north room danse naked , grotesquely before my mirror waving my shirt round my head and singing softly to myself : “I am lonely, lonely. I was born to be lonely . I am best so !” If I admire my arms , my face, my shoulders , flanks , buttocks against the yellow drawn shades ,— <|endoftext|>
Fresh up then, dear nightingale, Thou waterfall with bright sound! Let us praise God united, Until the bright morning shines! <|endoftext|>
He rose, who slept for a long time, rose from the vaults deep below. In the dusk he stands, tall and unrecognized, And crushes the moon in his black hand. <|endoftext|>
Remove the crosses out of the earth, and let them all become swords; God in heaven will forgive them: the oppressors and the Philistines, and the sword has its priests, and we will be priests. <|endoftext|>
Our feet rest on the preciousness, thousands upon thousands. <|endoftext|>
She holds herself trembling on the bench. The room sways around her from her cry, Then comes the fruit. Her womb gapes red and long, And bleeding it tears in two from the fruit. <|endoftext|>
Upward or downward! reigns in holy night, Where the mute nature meditates days, Does not a degree, a right still reign in the crooked orcus? <|endoftext|>
If once the tired eyelids fall, extinguish it, then the soul has rest; groping, it strips off the hiking shoes, lays down also in its dark chest. <|endoftext|>
The little ship flies, the loom crashes, We weave diligently day and night - Old Germany, we weave your shroud, We weave into it the threefold curse, We weave, we weave! <|endoftext|>
On the wave twinkle a thousand floating stars, soft mists drink round the storming distance; morning wind wafts around The shaded bay, And in the lake the ripening fruit is reflected. <|endoftext|>
FROM harmony , from heavenly harmony This universal frame began : When nature underneath a heap Of jarring atoms lay , And could not heave her head , The tuneful voice was heard from high , Arise , ye more than dead . Then cold , and hot , and moist , and dry , In order to their stations leap , And Music "s power obey . From harmony , from heavenly harmony This universal frame began : From harmony to harmony Through all the compass of the notes it rail , The diapason closing full in Man . <|endoftext|>
I looked at you; my life hung in the balance, and I didn't know it. <|endoftext|>
With the springs goes my greetings, And the deaf heart in me has had to awaken to the God Who protects us for and for. <|endoftext|>
Heart, my heart, what shall this give you? Why is it so distressing to you? What a strange new life! I do not recognize you any more. Away is all that you loved, way why you were afflicted, way is your diligence and your rest? Oh, how did you come to this! <|endoftext|>
The balmy night wind blows her breath, so ghostly, extinguishingly quiet sound: she cries in a dream, she breathes deeply and heavily, she lisps, enigmatically, temptingly bang... <|endoftext|>
Of this worlds theatre in which we stay, My love like the spectator ydly sits Beholding me that all the pageants play, Disguysing diversly my troubled wits. Sometimes I joy when glad occasion fits, And mask in myrth lyke to a comedy: Soone after when my joy to sorrow flits, I waile and make my woes a tragedy. Yet she, beholding me with constant eye, Delights not in my merth nor rues my smart: But when I laugh she mocks, and when I cry She laughs and hardens evermore her heart. What then can move her? if nor merth nor mone, She is no woman, but a senceless stone. <|endoftext|>
The moon emerges from the yellow wall of clouds. The lunatics hang on the bars, like large spiders sticking to walls. Along the garden fence their hand travels. <|endoftext|>
What do we imagine, what do we wish to have? Now flowers, tomorrow excrement. We are a wind, a foam, <|endoftext|>
O well for the fisherman "s boy , That he shouts with his sister at play ! O well for the sailor lad , That he sings in his boat on the bay ! <|endoftext|>
my blood approves and kisses are a better fate than wisdom lady i swear by all flowers. Don"t cry —the best gesture of my brain is less than your eyelids" flutter which says <|endoftext|>
Like a tower he steps out of the last embers. Where the day flees, the streams are already full of blood. Countless corpses are already stretched out in the reeds, covered white with birds strong in death. <|endoftext|>
Love cannot help us, Love cannot save us; Hold on, O hatred, your recent judgment, Break, O hatred, the chains! And where there are still tyrants, Which let us grasp boldly; We have loved long enough, And will hate at last! <|endoftext|>
Sound sleep by night ; study and ease , Together mixt ; sweet recreation ; And Innocence , which most does please With meditation . <|endoftext|>
Rustle, river, along the valley, without rest and rest, rustle, whisper melodies to my singing! <|endoftext|>
Stunned, I look up, I kneel to listen to their song of light. <|endoftext|>
And they run! Wet and wet. Be in the hall and on the steps. What terrible waters! Lord and Master! hear me call!? Ah, here comes the Master! Lord, the distress is great! Those I called, I will not get rid of the spirits. <|endoftext|>
In what distant deeps or skies Burnt the fire of thine eyes ? On what wings dare he aspire ? What the hand dare seize the fire ? <|endoftext|>
And the King beckons again, Then a second gate opens nimbly, Out of it a tiger runs with a wild leap, As he beholds the lion, he roars loudly, Strikes with his tail a terrible frost, And sticks out his tongue, And in a circle shyly he bypasses the Leu, purring fiercely; Then he stretches down to the side, grumbling. <|endoftext|>
?o i <|endoftext|>
In every cry of every man , In every infant "s cry of fear , In every voice , in every ban , The mind-forged manacles I hear : <|endoftext|>
In the corner, broom, broom, have been, because as ghosts, only the old master calls you out for his sake. <|endoftext|>
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master; If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools: <|endoftext|>
Oh, the madness of the great city, when in the evening crippled trees stare at a black wall, the spirit of evil looks out of a silver mask; light with a magnetic scourge displaces the stony night. Oh, the sunken ringing of the evening bells. <|endoftext|>
All around the valleys are sloping, the air is already darkening, two larks are only rising into the fragrance at night. <|endoftext|>
How shall I hold my soul, lest it touch yours? How shall I lift it above you to other things? Oh, I would like to place it in the darkness with something lost, in a strange quiet place, which does not resonate when your depths vibrate; but everything that touches us, you and me, gathers us together like a bow drawing a voice from two strings. On which instrument are we curious? And which player has us in his hand? O sweet song. <|endoftext|>
And if Brutus were among us, he would never find Caesar, he would seek Caesar in vain; We have good gingerbread. <|endoftext|>
My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still, My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will, The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done, From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won; Exult O shores, and ring O bells! But I with mournful tread, Walk the deck my Captain lies, Fallen cold and dead. <|endoftext|>
Oh! my soul was grieved, As the soul of Ulysses, When he heard that Polyphemus pushed the boulder in front of the cave. <|endoftext|>
Under the lime trees At the heath There our two beds were. There we mugt both broken flowers and grass, in front of the forest in a valley. Tandaradei, schône sanc diu nahtegal. <|endoftext|>
Woe to me, where do I take the flowers when it is winter, and where the sunshine, and the shadow of the earth? The walls stand speechless and cold, the flags clank in the wind. <|endoftext|>
So the lark loves song and air, And morning flowers the scent of heaven, <|endoftext|>
Three skeletons, fantastically cleaned, with crowns on the miserable yellowed skulls, they also carried The Sceptre in bony hands. <|endoftext|>
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it, And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son! <|endoftext|>
Is kingly: thousands at his bidding speed, They also serve who only stand and wait.” <|endoftext|>
And adorned with laurel vines, Shaar wallows upon Shaar, To the altar of the Thymbrian, To the gods of the holy houses. Thumbingly roaring through the streets rolls the Bacchanalian lust, And in their sorrow was left but a sad breast. <|endoftext|>
The world - a gateway to a thousand deserts dumb and cold! Whoever lost what you lost will not stop anywhere. <|endoftext|>
Take up the White Man"s burden - Have done with childish days - The lightly proffered laurel, The easy, ungrudged praise. Comes now, to search your manhood Through all the thankless years, Cold-edged with dear-bought wisdom, The judgement of your peers. <|endoftext|>
From the pointy head of the citizen the hat flies, In all the air it resounds like shouting. Roofers fall down and go in two And on the coasts? one reads? the tide rises. <|endoftext|>
We go and go until we finally get back to the Cathedral Square; the gates were wide open there, We entered. <|endoftext|>
Their pale larvae all send me Proserpina; Wherever I wander, wherever I wallow, the spirits stand there for me. In the youth joyful games they intrude cruelly, A dreadful tumult! I can never be merry. <|endoftext|>
The sound is muffled, as the tide returns along the quay. The city night flush floats like a white skin in the stream and rubs itself against the steamer resting in the dock. <|endoftext|>
And I have the windows open, New move into the world Old fear, old hope! Spring, spring it shall be! <|endoftext|>
My daily routine is: kneeling in a narrow boiler pipe under a small glow, pounding on rivets, sweating in the heat, sooty eyes and hair and ears. <|endoftext|>
Cruell and sodaine , hast thou since Purpled thy naile , in blood of innocence ? Wherein could this flea guilty bee , Except in that drop which it suckt from thee ? Yet thou triumph"st , and saist that thou Find"st not thy selfe , nor mee the weaker now ; ‘ Tis true , then learne how false , feares bee ; 25 Just so much honor , when thou yeeld"st to mee , Will wast , as this flea "s death tooke life from thee . <|endoftext|>
The ancient lullaby, She does not pay attention to it, she is tired of it; The blue of the sky sounds sweeter still, The yoke of fleeing hours evenly swung. But always the springs keep the word, The waters still sing away in their sleep Of the day, Of the day that has been today. <|endoftext|>
One even moved his mouth and gave a speech, very long; He explained to me why He demanded my respect. <|endoftext|>
How can those terrified vague fingers push The feathered glory from her loosening thighs? And how can body, laid in that white rush, But feel the strange heart beating where it lies? <|endoftext|>
Eyes, my dear little windows, Give me a pleasant glow for so long, kindly let in picture after picture: One day you will be darkened! <|endoftext|>
Beam after beam, colours in love, stars courting each other for heaven's sake. <|endoftext|>
Blessed is he who closes himself to the world without hatred, holds a friend by his bosom, and enjoys with him, <|endoftext|>
The day is sparse with sweet delights, It pains me the vain pangs of its light, And the embers of its sun consume me me. Therefore hide thyself from the splendour of errant suns! Shroud thyself in the night, it satisfies thy desire, And heals the pain, like Lethe's cool floods. <|endoftext|>
A funeral procession floats in the sea of the city, people cross the road, one after the other. A glance at my coffin, already over. The organ-turner turns his song. <|endoftext|>
And now good-morrow to our waking souls, Which watch not one another out of fear; For love, all love of other sights controls, And makes one little room an everywhere. Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone, Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown, Let us possess one world, each hath one, and is one. <|endoftext|>
When we march - step by step - We listen: our heart beats with us. My heart and your heart, comrade. In the same beat: soldier! soldier! <|endoftext|>
Take up the White Man"s burden - And reap his old reward, The blame of those ye better, The hate of those ye guard - The cry of hosts ye humour (Ah slowly !) towards the light:- "Why brought ye us from bondage, "Our loved Egyptian night ?" <|endoftext|>
He sat at the royal banquet, The knights around him, On high fathers "hall There on the castle by the sea. <|endoftext|>
Love and Time with reverence use, Treat them like a parting friend; Nor the golden gifts refuse Which in youth sincere they send: For each year their price is more, And they less simple than before. <|endoftext|>
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of being and ideal grace. I love thee to the level of every day"s Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light. I love thee freely, as men strive for right. I love thee purely, as they turn from praise. I love thee with the passion put to use In my old griefs, and with my childhood"s faith. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death. <|endoftext|>
They multiply, they are cut in pieces by the chariots. By the smoke of the night, like pus of a pestilence. <|endoftext|>
May God unite us Here I spin so alone, The moon shines clear and pure, I sing 'and want to cry. <|endoftext|>
A group of people, hardened by the merry-go-round, stagger silently into the poor cabins; while in the smoky canteens the great youth make a fuzzy noise. <|endoftext|>
Has found out thy bed Of crimson joy , And his dark secret love Does thy life destroy . <|endoftext|>
Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice. From what I’ve tasted of desire I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate To say that for destruction ice Is also great And would suffice. <|endoftext|>
? You know me well? from high stone Look silently at my castle deep into the Rhine. It is already late, it is already getting cold, never come out of this forest!? <|endoftext|>
I want to fly as a horseman into the bloody battle, To lie still in the field in the dark night. <|endoftext|>
My father, my father, and do you not see there the daughters of Erlkönig in a dark place? My son, my son, I see it very clearly: the old pastures seem so gray. <|endoftext|>
Does the blossom of youth bind you, This lovely figure, This gaze full of faithfulness and goodness With infinite force? Will I quickly withdraw from it, empower myself, escape it, Lead me in the moment, Oh, my way back to it. <|endoftext|>
And every time I marked a house in such a way, a death bell sounded far away, whimpering wistfully and softly. <|endoftext|>
My love is like to ice, and I to fire: How comes it then that this her cold so great Is not dissolved through my so hot desire, But harder grows the more I her entreat? Or how comes it that my exceeding heat Is not allayed by her heart-frozen cold, But that I burn much more in boiling sweat, And feel my flames augmented manifold? What more miraculous thing may be told, That fire, which all things melts, should harden ice, And ice, which is congeal"s with senseless cold, Should kindle fire by wonderful device? Such is the power of love in gentle mind, That it can alter all the course of kind. <|endoftext|>
And that goes and hurries, that it ends, and just circles and turns and has no goal. A red, a green, a gray sent by, a little barely begun profile -. And sometimes a smile, turned, a blissful one that dazzles and wastes on this breathless blind game... <|endoftext|>
Night rain envelops the place in a cave, And purple jellyfish lie - colorful oils; <|endoftext|>
"Dear child, come, go with me! I play beautiful games with you; there are many colourful flowers on the beach, My mother has many a golden robe." <|endoftext|>
TAKE up the White Man"s burden - Send forth the best ye breed - Go bind your sons to exile To serve your captives" need; To wait in heavy harness On fluttered folk and wild - Your new-caught sullen peoples, Half devil and half child. Take up the White Man"s burden - In patience to abide To veil the threat of terror And check the show of pride; By open speech and simple, An hundred times made plain, To seek another"s profit, And work another"s gain. <|endoftext|>
Of Manners gentle , of Affections mild ; In Wit , a Man ; Simplicity , a Child : With native Humour temp"ring virtuous Rage , Form "d to delight at once and lash the age : Above Temptation , in a low Estate , And uncorrupted , ev"n among the Great : A safe Companion , and an easy Friend , Unblam "d thro ’ Life , lamented in thy End . These are Thy Honours ! not that here thy Bust Is mix "d with Heroes , or with Kings thy dust ; But that the Worthy and the Good shall say , Striking their pensive bosoms — Here lies GAY . <|endoftext|>
Sing softly, softly, softly, sings a whispering lullaby; from the moon learns the wise man who moves so silently in the sky. <|endoftext|>
A small ring Limits our lives, And many genders line them constantly, To their existence Infinite Chain. <|endoftext|>
Do you not hear the springs go far between stone and flowers After the silent forest lakes, Where the marble paintings stand In the beautiful solitude? From the mountains gently descend, Awakening the ancient songs, Rises the wonderful night, And the grounds shine again, As dus often thought in a dream. <|endoftext|>
The gods pale when you approach! You have plastered many a star on your ways with the flapping of your wings! <|endoftext|>
They lean heavily on a bridge wall, and stick their hands out into the swarm of men, like fauna drilling their arms into the mud at the edge of the swamps. <|endoftext|>
In Maienseeds the corpses lie narrow, In the green rain, on flowers, on their beds. Lost weapons, wheels without spokes, And overturned the iron carriages. <|endoftext|>
Seemed to be a snake's head at times, and I heard him secretly hissing: "You are and remain in the fortress now, you can't escape!" <|endoftext|>
Narrow, untangled to blue melodies, it stirs the will and mind of the water <|endoftext|>
AT ten A.M. the young housewife moves about in negligee behind the wooden walls of her husband"s house. I pass solitary in my car. Then again she comes to the curb to call the ice-man, fish-man, and stands shy, uncorseted, tucking in stray ends of hair, and I compare her to a fallen leaf. The noiseless wheels of my car rush with a crackling sound over dried leaves as I bow and pass smiling. <|endoftext|>
The night rose serenely to the land, leaning dreaming against the mountain wall, Her eye now sees the golden scales of time resting still in the same bowls; And the springs rushing boldly forth, They sing to the mother, the night, in the ear Of the day, Of the day that has been today. <|endoftext|>
As he , defeated , dying , On whose forbidden ear The distant strains of triumph Break , agonized and clear ! <|endoftext|>
A noiseless patient spider , I mark "d where on a little promontory it stood isolated , Mark "d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding , It launch "d forth filament , filament , filament out of itself , Ever unreeling them , ever tirelessly speeding them . <|endoftext|>
Tyger , tyger , burning bright In the forests of the night , What immortal hand or eye Could frame thy fearful symmetry ? <|endoftext|>
The bunch of lunatics look amused, but soon they look like mice crawling into the ground. <|endoftext|>
A kiss has breathed life into me, the deepest languishing of my bosom, Come, darkness! to look around me, That new bliss sucks my lips. <|endoftext|>
Take up the White Man"s burden - Ye dare not stoop to less - Nor call too loud on Freedom To cloak your weariness; By all ye cry or whisper, By all ye leave or do, The silent sullen peoples Shall weigh your Gods and you. <|endoftext|>
The flower that smiles to-day To-morrow dies ; All that we wish to stay Tempts and then flies . What is this world "s delight ? Lightning that mocks the night , Brief even as bright . <|endoftext|>
And lonely as it is that loneliness Will be more lonely ere it will be less-- A blanker whiteness of benighted snow With no expression, nothing to express. <|endoftext|>
In the tavern I felt even worse, I did not want to taste the food. I went to sleep immediately, but I did not sleep, the blankets were so heavy. <|endoftext|>
There stood the old draughtsman, drinking the last glow of life, and throwing the holy cup down into the flood. <|endoftext|>
We rest the deceased under the Dutch bushes, watching the grey seagulls. <|endoftext|>
What distinguishes gods from men? That many waves walk before them, An eternal stream: the wave lifts us, the wave swallows us, And we sink. <|endoftext|>
Dust, fruit, paper, in a thick layer, So the excrement drifts out of its tubes whole. A white dance dress comes, in fat luster A naked neck and lead-white a face. <|endoftext|>
The winter evening settles down With smell of steaks in passageways . Six o"clock . The burnt-out ends of smoky days . And now a gusty shower wraps The grimy scraps Of withered leaves about your feet And newspapers from vacant lots ; The showers beat On broken blinds and chimney-pots , And at the corner of the street A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps . And then the lighting of the lamps . <|endoftext|>
We have gone through adversity and joy hand in hand, from hiking we both now rest over the quiet land. <|endoftext|>
And on this magic thread, which cannot be torn, the dear loose girl holds Me so against her will; must now live in her magic circle in her own way. The change, oh, how great! Love! Love! Let me go! <|endoftext|>
Fort! away from here! in the deep grave Is your natural place. Life is now taking possession of the treasures of this chapel. <|endoftext|>
Heaven flows in channels of stone; For all the streets are hewn out into channels, full of the blue of heaven; And domes are like buoys, vents like stakes <|endoftext|>
That murmur, soon replies, “God doth not need Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state <|endoftext|>
Heart, my heart, why so joyful, so full of restlessness and scattered, As if the beautiful spring season had come upon the mountains? <|endoftext|>
Marke but this flea , and marke in this , How little that which thou deny"st me is ; It suck "d me first , and now sucks thee , And in this flea , our two bloods mingled bee ; Thou know"st that this cannot be said A sinne , nor shame , nor losse of maidenhead , Yet this enjoyes before it wooe , And pamper "d swells with one blood made of two , And this , alas , is more then wee would doe . <|endoftext|>
I hear you when the wave rises there with a dull noise. In the quiet grove I often go to listen, When everything is silent. <|endoftext|>
Fight them without ceasing, The tyranny of the earth, And our hatred will become more holy, As our love. Until our hand is reduced to ashes, Shall it not forsake the sword; We have loved long enough, And will hate at last! <|endoftext|>
A corporal came up to the car and asked us: "My name is nobody, I'm an ophthalmologist and I stab the star." <|endoftext|>
On the gray beach, on the gray sea, And on the side lies the city; The fog weighs heavily on the roofs, And through the silence the sea roars monotonously around the city. <|endoftext|>
The boatman in the small ship is seized with wild woe; He does not look at the rock reefs, He only looks up to the heights. <|endoftext|>
Since I took your narrow hands This is a long time ago. <|endoftext|>
Do you see the city resting over there, whispering into the garment of the night? The moon of silk pours down upon it in magical splendor. <|endoftext|>
The others flee through darkened arcades; the starry wind, like raging maenads. <|endoftext|>
And now his spirits shall also live according to my will. I note his words and works and the custom, And with strength of spirit I also do miracles. <|endoftext|>
Behold, he runs down to the shore, verily! is already at the river, And with lightning speed he is here again with swift pouring. Already for the second time! How the basin swells! How every bowl is filled with water! <|endoftext|>
A game bleeds gently on the rain and ravens ripple in bloody pours. The pipe shakes yellow and shot up. Frost, smoke, a step in the empty grove. <|endoftext|>
Oh further, quiet peace! So deep in the twilight, How are we weary of wandering? Is this death? <|endoftext|>
The nymphs have left the golden forests, the stranger is buried, and then a flickering rain begins. Pan's son appears in the form of an earthworker, who sleeps on the glowing asphalt at noon. There are little girls in a courtyard in dresses full of heart-rending poverty. They are rooms filled with chords and sonatas. They are shadows hugging each other in front of a blind mirror. Convalescents are warming up at the windows of the hospital. A white steamer by the canal carries up bloody plagues. <|endoftext|>
The pale death with his cold hand will at last stroke your breasts with time / The sweet coral of your lips will fade; The shoulders of warm snow will become cold sand / <|endoftext|>
Of all the Poisons that the fruitful Earth E"er yet brought forth , or Monsters she gave Birth , Nought to Mankind has e"er so fatal been , As thou , accursed Gold , their Care and Sin . <|endoftext|>
His nightingale sounds slumber down on him, His nightingale wakes him up fluttering, When the lovely Frühhroth Through the Trees shines on his bed. <|endoftext|>
It drips past me into the sea of nothingness. One by one, one by one. A glance at his coffin, already over. The organ-turner turns his song. <|endoftext|>
I hear a sickle rustle, well rustle through the corn, I hear a maiden lament that she has lost her love. <|endoftext|>
And the wild boy broke the little horse on the heathens; and the little horse fought back and stabbed him, but no woe or woe helped him, must he suffer? little horse, little horse, red horse, little horse on the heathens. <|endoftext|>
I let my face fall on stars, which limp apart as if struck. The forests wander moonward, black jellyfish, into the blue sea, from which my gaze beckons. <|endoftext|>
The well-set foot / the lovely gestures / For no one sacrifices any more to the divinity of your splendour. <|endoftext|>
Two sails illuminating The deep blue bay! Two sails swelling To calm escape! <|endoftext|>
My eye clung to your face, my ear to your heavens - forgive the spirit who, intoxicated by your light, lost the earthly. <|endoftext|>
The brown waves of fog toss up to me Twisted faces from the bottom of the street , And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts An aimless smile that hovers in the air And vanishes along the level of the roofs . <|endoftext|>
I hear the brooks rushing here and there in the forest, In the forest in the rushing I do not know where I am. <|endoftext|>
Beyond rise kindly, In tiny, colorful form, pleasure houses, and gardens, and people, And oxen, and meadows, and forest. <|endoftext|>
And the playing troop whirrs down to him, cooing and whispering at him, flapping at him on the basket; pick crumbs and peas, pick grains out of his hand. <|endoftext|>
But when I listened to her speechless, she woke up from her slumber. <|endoftext|>
And what shoulder and what art Could twist the sinews of thy heart ? And , when thy heart began to beat , What dread hand and what dread feet ? <|endoftext|>
Rose leaves , when the rose is dead , Are heaped for the beloved "s bed ; And so thy thoughts , when thou art gone , Love itself shall slumber on . <|endoftext|>
For no man shall measure himself against gods. If he lifts himself up and touches the stars with the crown of his head, the unstable soles will not stick anywhere, and clouds and winds will play with him. <|endoftext|>
Turning and turning in the widening gyre The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity. <|endoftext|>
In front of his Lion Garden, awaiting the fighting game, sat King Francis, And around him the great ones of the crown, And all around on high balconies The ladies in beautiful wreath. <|endoftext|>
The world is still full of roles that we play. As long as we care whether we like it or not, death also plays, even though it doesn't like it. <|endoftext|>
My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears, And true plain hearts do in the faces rest; Where can we find two better hemispheres, Without sharp north, without declining west? Whatever dies, was not mixed equally; If our two loves be one, or, thou and I Love so alike, that none do slacken, none can die. <|endoftext|>
When I, deeply satisfied by your vision, silently delight in your holy value, then I hear the gentle breaths of the angel who is veiled in you. <|endoftext|>
Joy was in the halls of Troy, Eh the high feast fell; Hymns of exultation are heard In the strings golden play; All hands rest weary From the tearful strife, Because the glorious Pelide marries Priam's beautiful daughter. <|endoftext|>
Gone is the light day, From afar comes the sound of the bells; Thus time travels all night, taking with it some who have not thought it. <|endoftext|>
When the stars threw down their spears , And watered heaven with their tears , Did he smile his work to see ? Did he who made the lamb make thee ? <|endoftext|>
So richly adorned is the horse and the woman, so beautiful is the young body, Now do I know thee? God help me! Thou art the witch Lorelei. <|endoftext|>
My father, my father, and dost thou not hear what the king of the alder softly promises me? Be quiet, be quiet, my child; the wind whispers in dry leaves. <|endoftext|>
The woods around it have it--it is theirs. All animals are smothered in their lairs. I am too absent-spirited to count; The loneliness includes me unawares. <|endoftext|>
Inebriate of air am I , And debauchee of dew , Reeling , through endless summer days , From inns of molten blue . <|endoftext|>
Each echo makes my heart feel happy and sad, shifting between joy and pain in loneliness. <|endoftext|>
When we thirst, the sweetness of our sad childhood. <|endoftext|>

You walk a thousand streets all your life; you see in your walk those who forgot you. An eye beckons, the soul sounds; you hasten to find, only for seconds... Two strange eyes, a brief glance, the brow, pupils, the eyelids; What was that? no one turns back time... past, blown away, never again. <|endoftext|>
What goes down tired today, is reborn tomorrow. Some things remain lost in the night - beware, stay awake and lively! <|endoftext|>

s evil dreams. Resting in the hazel bushes she plays with his shadows. The student, perhaps a doppelganger, looks at her for a long time from the window. Behind him stands his dead brother, or he goes down the old spiral staircase. In the darkness of brown chestnuts the figure of the young novice fades. The garden is in the evening. In the cloister the bats flutter around. The children of the caretaker stop playing and look for the gold of the sky. End chords of a quartet. The little blind woman walks trembling through the alley, And later her shadow gropes along cold walls, surrounded by fairy tales and sacred legends. <|endoftext|>
