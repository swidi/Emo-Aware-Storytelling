And as he beckons with his finger, On opens the wide kennel, And into it with deliberate step A lion steps, And looks around silently, With a long yawn, And shakes his mane, And stretches out his limbs, And lays down. <|endoftext|>
The sails / where the desires wind blows / Is the thought cloth. Desire / hope are the anchors. The magnet is beauty. Our vortex are Bathseben. The wine and abundance the packs. <|endoftext|>

Sleeps a song in all things, Which dream on and on, And the world begins to sing, If you meet only the magic word. <|endoftext|>
I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then? But sucked on country pleasures, childishly? Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers’ den? ’Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be. If ever any beauty I did see, Which I desired, and got, ’twas but a dream of thee. <|endoftext|>
Drive away the thick night that surrounds my soul, refresh my mind and strengthen my confidence. <|endoftext|>
Oh how they disturb the brown silence, In which a field raptures, Like a woman who bewitches heavy foreboding, And sometimes you can hear her groaning <|endoftext|>
Happy the man whose wish and care A few paternal acres bound , Content to breathe his native air , In his own ground . <|endoftext|>
Who rides so late through night and wind? It is the father with his child; He has the boy in his arms, He holds him securely, He keeps him warm. <|endoftext|>
I hear America singing , the varied carols I hear , Those of mechanics , each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong , The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam , The mason singing his as he makes ready for work , or leaves off work , The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat , the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck , The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench , the hatter singing as he stands , The wood-cutter "s song , the ploughboy "s on his way in the morning , or at noon intermission or at sundown , The delicious singing of the mother , or of the young wife at work , or of the girl sewing or washing , Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else , The day what belongs to the day — at night the party of young fellows , robust , friendly , Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs . <|endoftext|>
In a street a lunatic groans: You, oh, you? A crowd around him marvels and grins with derision. <|endoftext|>
The nightingales strike here in solitude, as if they wanted to say something about the old, beautiful time. <|endoftext|>
Now you stand pale, cursed to winter wanderings, like the smoke that always searches for colder skies. <|endoftext|>
But then they sway again, sleeping and eyeing, scattered by the shackles. Waiting for witnesses. <|endoftext|>
Potsdamer Platz in eternal roar Glaciers all echoing avalanches The road tracts: trams on iron rails, automobiles and human waste. <|endoftext|>

Twilight and evening bell, And after that the dark! And may there be no sadness of farewell, When I embark; <|endoftext|>
Take up the White Man"s burden - The savage wars of peace - Fill full the mouth of famine And bid the sickness cease; And when your goal is nearest The end for others sought, Watch Sloth and heathen Folly Bring all your hopes to nought. <|endoftext|>
In a cool ground There goes a mill wheel, My beloved is gone, Who has lived there. <|endoftext|>
To serve therewith my Maker, and present My true account, lest He returning chide, “Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?” I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent <|endoftext|>
That which was yesterday is gone; that which raises happiness shall perish tomorrow; the green branches which were before are now dry and dead; we poor are but guests, whether a sharp sword of delicate silk hovers over them. <|endoftext|>
When my love swears that she is made of truth , I do believe her , though I know she lies , That she might think me some untutor "d youth , Unskilful in the world "s false forgeries , Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young , Although I know my years be past the best , I smiling credit her false-speaking tongue , Outfacing faults in love with love "s ill rest . But wherefore says my love that she is young ? And wherefore say not I that I am old ? O , love "s best habit is a soothing tongue , And age , in love , loves not to have years told . Therefore , I "ll lie with love , and love with me , Since that our faults in love thus smother "d be . <|endoftext|>
We are minded to stand together. Disease, persecution, sorrow, and anguish shall be the bonding of our love. Change of Tharau, my riches, my wealth, my soul, my flesh, and my blood. <|endoftext|>
And the flames devour burning forest after forest, yellow bats clawed into the leaves, and he hews his rod like a charcoal-burner into the trees, so that the fire roars right. <|endoftext|>
I wailed for a long time, and the cock crowed, and the fever dream faded. I lay in the sweating bed at Minden, and the eagle became a tassel again. <|endoftext|>
What passion cannot Music raise and quell ? When Jubal struck the chorded shell , His listening brethren stood around , And , wondering , on their faces fell To worship that celestial sound . Less than a God they thought there could not dwell Within the hollow of that shell , That spoke so sweetly and so well . What passion cannot Music raise and quell ? <|endoftext|>
It is already late, it is already getting cold, What are you riding? Are you riding alone through the forest? The forest is long, you are alone, you beautiful bride! I am taking you home! <|endoftext|>

When you go to work in the early morning, when you stand at the train station With your worries: the city shows you millions of faces in the human funnel: two strange eyes, a quick glance, the brow, pupils, the eyelids? What was that? maybe your happiness in life... over, blown away, never again. <|endoftext|>

The "swallow" flies over Lake Erie, spray foams around the bow like flakes of snow; from Detroit it flies to Buffalo - but the hearts are free and happy, and the passengers with children and women are already looking at the shore in the twilight, and chatting to John Maynard everything comes up: "How far still, helmsman?" He looks forward and looks around: "Thirty minutes left... half an hour." <|endoftext|>
From many puddles the smoke of blood steams, Which black and red cover the brown dirt road. And whitish swells the belly of the dead horses, Which stretch their legs into the morning. <|endoftext|>
The soul races in the eye, poor and wandering. To earth, man, and light. So cry, man in iron! <|endoftext|>
O thou offspring of hell! Shall the whole house be drowned? I see streams of water running over every threshold! A wicked broom that will not hear! Stick, which thou hast been, stand still! <|endoftext|>

She sees two little sparks still standing smouldering, like two little stars to see inwardly, Till they waver and then also pass away, As of a butterfly's wingspan. <|endoftext|>
sometimes come upon us, like a knowledge of that reality descending, so that we play life for a while rapturously, not thinking of applause. <|endoftext|>
Long years ago the Nightingale sang, That was probably sweet sound, Since we were together. <|endoftext|>
A strong wind leapt up. Open the bleeding gates of the iron sky. Strike the towers. Sounding loud and supple over the iron plain of the city. The morning sun sooty. Trains thunder on dams. Golden angel ploughs plough through clouds. Strong wind over the pale city. Steamers and cranes awaken at the filthy flowing stream. Annoyingly the bells knock at the weathered cathedral. You see many women and girls going to work. In the pale light. Wild from the night. Their skirts weave. Limbs created for love. Towards the machine and grumpy toil. Look into the tender light. In the trees tender green. Listen! The sparrows shrine. And outside in wilder fields larks sing. <|endoftext|>
When the sun has gone, darkness comes, sunset has golden cheeks, and the night has mourning. <|endoftext|>

In vain , in vain — the all-composing Hour Resistless falls : the Muse obeys the Pow"r . She comes ! she comes ! the sable Throne behold Of Night primæval and of Chaos old ! Before her , Fancy "s gilded clouds decay , And all its varying Rain-bows die away . Wit shoots in vain its momentary fires , The meteor drops , and in a flash expires . As one by one , at dread Medea "s strain , The sick"ning stars fade off th ’ ethereal plain ; As Argus ’ eyes by Hermes ’ wand opprest , Clos "d one by one to everlasting rest ; Thus at her felt approach , and secret might , Art after Art goes out , and all is Night . See skulking Truth to her old cavern fled , Mountains of Casuistry heap "d o"er her head ! Philosophy , that lean "d on Heav"n before , Shrinks to her second cause , and is no more . Physic of Metaphysic begs defence , And Metaphysic calls for aid on Sense ! See Mystery to Mathematics fly ! In vain ! they gaze , turn giddy , rave , and die . Religion blushing veils her sacred fires , And unawares Morality expires . For public Flame , nor private , dares to shine ; Nor human Spark is left , nor Glimpse divine ! Lo ! thy dread Empire , CHAOS ! is restor "d ; Light dies before thy uncreating word ; Thy hand , great Anarch ! lets the curtain fall , And universal Darkness buries All . <|endoftext|>

I went home and slept as if The Angels had cradled me. One rests in German beds so soft, Because these are feather beds. <|endoftext|>
If you still have a heart, let it stir in your hatred; there is dry wood everywhere to stir up our embers; those of you who remain free, sing through the streets of Germany: "You have loved long enough, O learn to hate at last!" <|endoftext|>
Forehead of God dreams colors, senses of madness gentle wings. Shadows turn on the hill Black fringed by decay. <|endoftext|>
You sleep very well and dream well in our duvets. Here the German soul feels free from all chains of earth. <|endoftext|>

The most beautiful maiden sits up there wonderfully; her golden jewels sparkle, she combs her golden hair. <|endoftext|>
In an old book I came across a word that struck me like a blow and burns away through my days: And when I forgive myself for gloomy lust, when I lift up appearances, lies and games to me instead of the being, When I lie to myself with a swift sense, As if dark things were clear, as if life did not carry a thousand wildly locked gates, And contradict words whose breadth I never felt, And grasp things whose being never troubled me, When a welcome dream strokes me with velvet walls, And day and reality escapes from me, Alienated from the world, alien to the deepest I, Then the word rises to me: Man, become essential! <|endoftext|>
The maids bleach laundry, And leap about in the grass; The mill wheel dusts diamonds, I hear its distant hum. <|endoftext|>

In the end, I think the waves devour Schiffer and Kahn; and that's what Die Lore-Ley did with her singing. <|endoftext|>
Windows stand close together like the holes in a sieve, houses huddle together so tightly that the streets are swollen with gray like strangled people. <|endoftext|>
HOW soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth, Stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year! My hasting days fly on with full career, But my late spring no bud or blossom shew’th. Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth, That I to manhood am arrived so near, And inward ripeness doth much less appear, That some more timely-happy spirits indu’th. Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow, It shall be still in strictest measure even To that same lot, however mean or high, Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven, All is, if I have grace to use it so, As ever in my great Task-master’s eye <|endoftext|>
