A happy song of joy, a song of joy, I sing to you, 
Joy, when I am dead.

I will not know whether I love you with all my heart, or if you hate me with all my soul, I will not know, I will not know whether your love presses me to my breast, or presses it beneath my breast.

On my breast will grow sad flowers, 
And I will lament and weep, 
And you who are in front of me will be struck by cold.

================================================================================
And when the smoke is gone, the glow of the candles will not be there, 
And where the fire burned, there will be no fire.

And when the sun goes down, it will be late, 
And the night will be gray, 
And the flowers will be thin, 
And your eyelashes will be grey, 
And your fingers will be cold, 
And your mouth will be wide open, 
And when the wind blows, it will not be clear, 
And the moon will be heavy, 
And the stars will be green, 
And when the wind blows, you will feel my soul throbbing, 
And you will feel my heart throbbing harder,

And the sun will shine, and the stars will shine, 
And the sea will be silent, 
And the quiet shall be sweet.

================================================================================
And sometimes I think: he will play a trick on me; he will do a great error, and I will play a trick on him; I will not know what he is doing! 
Then I will be hurt, 
And I will be sorry: but that is all. 
He has lost his way, 
And has lost his good fortune.

And the sun will be up and the moon will be down, and the best of the valley will be watered by the sweet stream.

In the night the moon shines, 
And the golden waves are like the sea, 
And the blue night is like a castle, 
So I do not know where I am.

================================================================================
Oh, my heart will go on; my eyelids will stay on and my brows will rise and fall.

Now I see the terrible things that befall me, 
In the valley of the blind steeple, 
The great, the monstrous things, the horrible things, 
A thousand times, in the valley of the blind steeple.

Until I meet you in the field, and see you at the gate, my beloved. 
Until you are right in the middle of the world, my little friend. 
Until I am as happy as a lion in the field. 
Until you are a star in the sky on the edge of the world.

================================================================================
And I will not rest till I have found out what is the spirit of the world. 
Then I will be glad to die, and my spirit will go on.

My heart will go on, my heart will go on! 
And how I will grieve, 
How I will weep, 
How I will laugh! 
And how I will be silent! 
How I will have no friend - - - 
My heart will not stop, 
My heart will not stop! 
And how my heart will be heavy!

And all my love will become a stone. 
And I will see my beloved again, 
And he will say: "
You are not my true husband, you are my mother, I am your son, as you are my flesh and blood."

================================================================================
I will always be watching the stars; I will never be weary. I will always be happy. 
Joy 
Joy 
Joy

And the waves of joy will lift me up into the heavens, 
And I will be glad: 
Then the clouds will disappear, 
And I will be like sunshine, 
When the blue sky will be full of joy.

And I shall be sad like a bird, 
And shall lament and weep, 
And shall hide my heart like a hatchet.

================================================================================
And I will be happy for ever, if you will let me go. I will not be glad to see you, I will not be glad to go out again, 
And I will not mind if you let me go.

"
My heart will go on, 
O my heart will go on, it will not rest on the earth, but will dwell on the mountains, on the rivers, and will sing in the streets, 
O my heart will go on, it will not rest, nor will it rest on the sky, and will sing to heaven, I will sing to heaven: 
My heart will not rest, nor will it rest on the earth, but will dwell on the mountains, and on the rivers, and will sing to heaven, 
O my heart will go on,

I see you on the street, you sit and look at people, you smile, and you laugh. 
You are the silent one, you are the one who has to stand, you are the silent one who has to wait.

================================================================================
And my soul will delight in the praise of 
God, 
In praise of 
God, I will serve and rejoice in the 
Lord.

But when the wind dies away, I feel myself falling away; 
When I look at the stars, 
They are no more. I die soon, I die young, 
In the quiet of the forest.

I will never know joy again, and you will never know pain. 
Happiness, too, will fade away.

================================================================================
If not, my heart will go on, 
If I have to wait until it is time; 
And the same is true: 
If I am not then, I have to wait till it is too late.

I am so tired of being away from you and from my home. 
That's what I want. I want my home, my loved one, to be with me.

And in the midst of all the confusion of my day, in the midst of all the distress, I will sing: I want you, 
O 
God, to know that I am yours!

================================================================================
And the joy of life will be with me, 
And the joy of my soul will be with me; 
And I will be glad, 
And happy in every way; 
And all the children of 
God will be happy with me.

The moon will smile, the flowers will kiss, 
And the stars will shine on the ground, 
And the streets will shine with a thousand people, 
And I will not be lonely.

I have been thinking of you, I have loved you, I have loved you with a heart like iron, I have loved you with a soul like gold.

================================================================================
I want to go on, and so will all those who stand by, 
Because I will not rest until everything is quiet.

I hear a knock on the door. I open the door with a wave of the hand. 
The knocker looks at me, confused. I stand there speechless. I am frozen.

As for me, I will live for all time in the city and in the land of the faithful. I will rejoice and sing to my children in the streets, I will build my house in the streets, and my name will be forever written in the walls.

================================================================================
I want to kiss the beautiful earth that I love; I want to sing the beautiful songs of nature; I want to dance the beautiful dances of the air;

I want to go away, but my heart will stay on, and my love will linger on, 
And I will not be a god, I will be a king, and I will be a friend.

I will not forgive myself for not taking your hand. 
And if I had taken it, you would not have been my husband. 
And if I had not taken it, you would not have been my friend. 
And if I had not taken it, you would not have had the honor of being a king!

================================================================================
I will sing to him, I will sing to him, 
And he will sing to me, 
And I will sing to him, 
And he will sing louder.

But, when the joy is gone, there is sorrow, 
And sorrow, 
And sorrow, 
And sorrow, and sorrow, 
And sorrow; 
And sorrow, 
And sorrow, 
And sorrow, 
And sorrow, 
And sorrow, and sorrow...

There is a song in the night, 
That cannot be heard, 
That I hear, 
And yet cannot forget, 
That I do not know; 
And yet, when I do, it is not as if there were no song in the world.

================================================================================
And my hand will be still with thee; 
But my heart will be broken, 
And my hand will be broken, 
And my heart will rest with thee.

The sea, which I love so deeply and cannot forget, kisses my bosom in return. 
So I shall return to you in bliss.

But happiness, which I seek, 
Will never be found. I will go on, happy in my heart, 
Happy on! I will not be satisfied. 
My heart will go on and on.

================================================================================
I have loved thee with all my heart, 
And will love thee with all my soul, 
And shall be satisfied with thee, and shall rejoice and delight in thee; 
And I will praise thee with all my heart, 
Till all the earth shall hear.

I will not listen to lamentations; I will not listen to those who lament, 
They tell me, 
My heart will go on, 
My heart will not rest, 
And my life will not return to me.

I will not listen to people who tell me that I am always sorry and that my suffering is always the right thing. 
The world has its sadder faces. 
The world has its sadder faces!

================================================================================
When the clouds are dry, 
The flowers shine 
In the sunshine, 
When the evening leaves blow, 
And we lift our eyes, 
Into the green heaven,

I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want to sing, I want

The sun will shine, the moon will shine, 
And I will feel sad. 
And I will go on, I will never go home.

================================================================================
The best of men say, "
My heart will go on long after it has been reduced to dust." 
But I tell you, it will go on no longer; and if it does, you have already done a good deal.

And it will go on, and it will go on, and on, and on, until the last whisper, the last glance, is out of my ears, 
Until the last breath, the last sound, the last word, is all that comes to me in the silence.

And when it finally does, I will never forgive myself. I will never forgive myself for not having known better.

================================================================================
And if you have not loved me deeply, I want to tell you what you have done to me: 
Your love has made me miserable, 
Your love has made me bitter, 
Your love has made me joyful, 
Your love has made me sad, 
And I want to be happy.

I will never forgive you! I will never forgive you! 
Because you are my enemy! 
Because you are the best of men! 
Because you are the only thing to unite us!

But no matter how long the line, I will never forget the moment when I caught it, 
And I said, "I am sorry!" 
And it was all over.

================================================================================
And I will not stop to think; 
But on the way I have a mind to pass along to you, 
Since you may in some way be the father of my life.

I want to kiss the flowers; you, too, me! 
As I know you will never let go.

Will never let go, will never let go of your hand! I will go on to the mountains, I will go on to the heights, I will go on to the seas! I will go on and on, to the glory of 
God!

================================================================================
But a thousand times I must let go, 
And I must not let go, 
And with a thousand hands I must not let go, 
As I wish; 
As I wish! 
Because I cannot let go!

I want to go on joyfully, as I did before, to the mountains, to the woods, to the sea, to the lakes, to the mountains, to the woods, to the sea, to the lakes, to the sun, to the moon, to the stars, to the wind, to the trees, to the grass, to the fruit, to the water, to the ground, to the earth, to everything that is.

And I will be sad, and I will suffer, and I will not feel: 
But my heart will go on.

================================================================================
But the soul, which is too weak to keep her silent, 
Must suffer and weep for a long time, and never rest for a moment. 
And though my heart is full, yet I cannot help it, 
And cannot make it stop.

I will not let go of you, you are dear to me. I will not let go of you, you are dear to me.

But the sea shall be my refuge, 
And the sky my refuge, 
And the trees my refuge; I will not be torn from them.

================================================================================
And if you have my heart, let me have yours, I will make you happy, I will show you the way, I will build you a house, I will love you, I will serve you, I will love you, I will sing, I will love you and you will hear me, I will sing, I will love you and you will listen, I will sing, I will love you and you will believe in me.

And I will rejoice in the peace which I have made for myself, 
And I will be happy in the possession of my beloved.

Oh, that I may have happiness and peace and joy , 
And happiness and peace and joy 
And happiness and peace and joy , 
With you , my dear , for ever !

================================================================================
I will be glad when I have to say I love thee, I love thee, I love thee, I love thee, I love thee.

I know not what I am, nor what I am to be, nor what I was. 
Since my birth, my life has been a dream. 
My life has been a game. 
It has been like a dream, and yet I know it is a game. I know that the man who has lived the life of a king was but a simple child. 
The game is all right. I am in it, I do it every day.

And if it goes on too long, 
And if my heart goes on too long, 
And if my heart goes on too long, I shall die! 
So will my heart go on forever!

================================================================================
I will sing the happy songs of joy, I will praise the heavenly songs of love, 
O joy, my heart will go on, as I will sing the songs of joy, as I sing to you, 
O joy, my heart will go on; my joy will go on.  I will sing the happy songs of joy, I will praise the heavenly songs of love, 
O joy, my heart will go on, as I will sing the songs of joy, as I sing to you, 
O joy, my heart will go on; my joy will go on. <

I will smile on; I will sing to you with my heart, I will sing to you with my song, I will sing to you with my song, I will sing to you with my word, I will sing to you with my word, I will sing to you with my word, I will sing to you with my word, I will sing to you with my word, I will sing to you with my word; I will smile, I will sing with my heart, I will sing to you with my heart, I will sing to you with my heart, I will

And I will not hear it, my heart will not go on, 
That the sun does not shine on me, 
Until I meet with the enemy, and have to bear my burden.

================================================================================
I will hear you from the cradle to the grave, I will see you on the grave, I will hear you cry out all night long, and then my heart will be saved.

But when I have let go, my heart will not let go. 
And what have I to say to my husband on the other side?

As you will feel the heart, I will feel the mind. 
One day, when your mind has been silent for far too long, I will go on, and it will not be long before you will lose it. I want to die, and to listen to your dying voice, 
And to say what you want to say: 
When you are dead, I die, too.

================================================================================
And I know that I have lived through it all. 
My heart will go on to the land of the living, 
And my life will go on to the land of the dead.

my heart will go on, 
O love! I will not rest until you are dead, till I see you in the grave, I will not let my heart rest until you are happy, 
Until I see you at the dance, you who danced with my heart.

The sun will shine far and wide, 
And you, too, will shine!

================================================================================
Will you not hear me in my song when I sing, "I will never be tired of playing with you / I will give you happiness, never fear / 
Oh, my heart will go on, I will never stop singing, I will sing through the night"?

Now I feel the sting of it, and I do not want to go on. 
And the more I feel it, the more I am going on.

What do I want? 
And what do I not want? 
And what is the use of speech? 
But a man, a man, a man! 
The hand that loves me is broken, the hand that loves thee is broken, the hand that loves me is broken.

================================================================================
Because the 
Lord lives in all things, 
And he loves all things equally, 
And does not want to see one of them mistreated, 
And does not want to hurt one of them, 
And does not want to destroy one of them.

And the heart of a young man will leap in my bosom, 
And the bosom of my heart will be red with joy.

In the dark depths of the night, in the night of the broken heart, the moon will shine darkly over my soul, 
And the stars will shine coldly, 
And the sky will be as cold as ice, 
And I will linger in the middle of the dark, 
Will linger in the middle of the dark, 
And the stars will shine coldly, 
And the moon will shine darkly over my soul, 
And the stars will shine coldly, 
And the sky will be as cold as ice, 
And I will linger in the middle of the dark, 
Will linger

================================================================================
Oh! what happiness will be mine! 
What happiness will be yours! 
What does life have to show? 
That happiness is yours! 
What more do you want?

I should like to be a poet, or a musician, or a playwright, or a poet; I should like to sing, and to play, and to sing to the king: I should like to be a poet, playing, singing, and to be merry.

And my heart will wander, 
And wander, 
And my thoughts will wander, 
And my heart will go on, 
And I will not be able to meet you.

================================================================================
And let the heart be broken with laughter; 
The night goes on in silence. 
The day is gone 
In the clouds. 
And the night will be torn by lightning.

And I will rejoice with them, 
Because I have been faithful to them, 
That I may also live to see their happiness.

And your voice will be a song of lamentation, 
And your love a song of woe. 
And the sorrow of my heart will be sweet in your praise. 
And the joy of my heart will be a song of joy. 
And the sorrow of my heart will be sweet in your praise.

================================================================================
And I will feel no pain, 
And I will love no man, 
And I will be happy, 
And my love will be full, 
And I will be happy.

How joyfully the sound of the bells of the church will echo through the quiet garden! 
How the beautiful bells of the church will sound through the quiet garden! 
Oh, how I have to stand there and listen!

And I will see in my heart , a bright and beautiful face , 
And in my heart will go on , 
And I will not smile , 
And I will not weep .

================================================================================
And when I come to my senses, I shall see my beloved in the morning, I shall see her again in the evening; I shall be happy, and I shall not be sad; I shall be happy and sad, I shall be happy and sad.

And through the night the stars will shine, 
And the moon will shine, 
And the stars will shine, 
And the moon will shine; 
And the wind will play with the bushes.

And when I shall be old, 
And all the world shall hear, 
And my spirit shall sink, 
And I shall be alone, 
And the sea shall be my refuge, 
And 
God shall forgive me my sin.

================================================================================
As I looked at that terrible shadow, it was like a pair of eyes watching me, but they did not move. 
And then it all began to sink in. 
And I saw a face at the bottom of the sea - a face with a mouth that looked like a horse's. 
And he looked at me. 
And he said: "
You are my salvation!" 
He looked at me. 
And he said: "
You are my salvation!" 
And he looked at me. 
And he said: "
You are my salvation!" 
He looked at me. 
And he said:

And I will go on, with the mind, and the heart; 
And I will not stop, because the sky is red with the blood of the saints.

I will wait for the dawn, I will wait for the sun and the moon and the stars and the clouds to shine down and tell the world what I have seen, what I have lost, what I have created.

================================================================================
When I see you with the sun, the moon, the stars, 
And you, too, on the promontory, I'm all yours!

But now I do not know; 
And I do not want to know, for I do not want to give way to the thoughts of my heart, 
For I do not want to know, for I do not want to let go of the times, 
But I do not want to know, for I do not want to let go of the times, 
And I do not want to know, for I do not want to let go of the times, 
And I do not want to know, for I do not want to let go of the times, 
And I do

And in my breast I will not lose my strength; 
From my breast to my breast I will not lose my strength; 
From my breast to my breast I will not lose my strength, 
Until my hand is broken.

================================================================================
The more I see it, the more I want it, 
The more I want it, 
The more I want it, 
The more I want it, 
The louder I want it, 
The more I want it, 
The more I want it, 
The more I want it, 
The louder I want it, 
The louder I want it, 
The louder I want it, 
The louder I want it, 
The louder I want it, 
The louder I want it, 
The louder I want it, 
The louder I want it, 
The louder I want it, 
The louder I want it,

So my heart will go on, 
And my soul will remain in the desert till the sun rises, 
And I will not see the earth again.

A little girl walks in the street, carries a rock in her hand, and waves it at the sky.

================================================================================
And then there will be a dream of the past, 
The stars will change, 
The night will be bright, 
And the air will be warm and clear, 
And the people will be young and beautiful, 
And there will be a little boy playing with the fishes.

For I do not know when I shall die, nor what shall become of me, but the love of 
God shall make me happy for ever!

I will walk with it always, on the heights, in the valleys, above the towers, in the night.

================================================================================
I see a woman standing, smiling and laughing, a little girl.

But then the joy of my heart will be broken, 
And the joy of my heart will be shattered; 
And the joy of my heart will be broken again, 
And the joy of my heart will be broken again, 
And the joy of my heart will be broken again.

And when I shall have given birth to my son, my heart shall also perish, 
And shall come to rest for ever in a chest of drawers.

================================================================================
I will die a happy man, I will not have to think of you.

I will not be satisfied with what I have. 
There is more to be desired, and I must also give up some of my pleasures. 
Oye, my heart, it must go on!

Because I want to see my beloved more clearly, 
And my heart will go on to the eternal world.

================================================================================
Shall we say that it has been six hundred years since the last time the earth was so filled with light and heat? 
Shall we say that the last year was the last in which the sun shone so brightly and so warmly on the world? 
Shall we say that the last year was the last in which the earth was so full of life and fragrance and sweetness and light and shade and shade of the sky? 
Shall we say that the last year was the last in which the mountains were so beautiful and full of moss and flowers? 
Shall we say that the last year

Where there are clouds of fog , 
And there are people riding in large dark chariots , 
And there is a great tower , 
And the great smoke of the smoke , 
And a great sound of steam , 
And a great mist that drifts away , 
And there is nothing but smoke in the streets , 
And the great noise of the noise .

My heart will go on, I will not stop, my days will pass like the days of my father.

================================================================================
And the soul will be a little more pure, 
And the heart will be a little more pure, 
And the soul will be a little more pure; 
And the heart will be a little more pure, 
And the heart will be a little more pure, 
And the soul will be a little more pure; 
And the heart will be a little more pure, 
And the heart will be a little more pure, 
And the soul will be a little more pure.

As soon as I hear the clangour of a bell, I know it is not the house. 
The bell is a buzzer. I hear it far away.

And still my heart will go on, 
And through my veins the blood will flow to the stars.

================================================================================
And when the clouds flee, 
And the moon rises bright 
And the stars sparkle, 
And we see the mountains rushing up; 
And the sun shines, 
And we sleep, 
And the earth awakens:

And as the old man walked away, the little child sang: "
My father!" "
Yes, my father!"

And I will rejoice in the praise of 
God and in the glory of 
God, 
Who has done all things for me.

================================================================================
And I will be glad that I live, because I have no one to care for me, and I need no one to love me.

And love will be loved, 
And peace will be granted, 
And happiness will reign in my heart; 
And my soul will rejoice in my breast, 
And rejoice joyfully in the praise of 
God, 
And 
God will bless me with his holy splendor.

I shall linger there, and shall not feel it, and shall not be aware of it.

================================================================================
My heart will go on, 
And so will yours; 
And mine alone will be eternal; 
And mine alone will be eternal.

And when my heart is gone, it will go on, for the world has not been my home, it has been only my brain.

I will not have it all! I will not have it all! I will not have it all! I will not have it all!

================================================================================
I will not rest until it is gone, I will not stop until it is gone, 
And I will not be silent till it is gone.

And the heart will go on, 
And the heart shall not stop. 
And if it goes on, it will not stop. 
And the beating of the heart shall be with me.

And when it ceases to be pleasant, it will be painless. 
And when it ceases to be pleasant, it will be painless.

================================================================================
I want to say I love you, but I can't.

The flowers will rot on the trees, the earth will be red with moss. 
As it is, it will remain the same.

I will go on, I will go on, 
And I will not give way! I will not give way! I will not give way! I will not give way!

================================================================================
Love, as you once loved me, is a curse; you curse me with your tears, that I may not cry out. 
Because I am so good at what I do, and am loved, I have to be so bad at what I do.

Behold! 
The blood streams into my veins and my veins into the sea, 
And the sea becomes a river, 
And the blood becomes a red-hot iron. 
And as if to a thousand times, my heart will go on.

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love

================================================================================
The little hand on the little eye 
Will hold me, I will not let go.

And so I do, I do, and more than that, I do it more than that. I do it more than that, I do it more than that, I do it more than that.

I will write in my heart that my heart will go on, even in the depths of sleep, and I will not dream of death.

================================================================================
And when it is gone there is no longer a soul, 
And the light of the sun, which shines so bright in the valley, 
Is lost in the clouds.

What shall we do? 
Shall we go with our hearts? 
Shall we be silent, and listen to the stars, to the silence of the night? 
O earth, what shall we do? 
Shall we be silent, and listen to the stars, to the silence of the night?

I will not let go of my heart, nor will I let go of my life, for the world is my home, and I am bound to it.

================================================================================
I will sing joy to my beloved, I will sing praise to my heavenly 
Father, I will sing praise to my 
King, I will sing praise to my 
God, I will sing praise to my 
Heavenly 
Father, I will sing praise to my 
Heavenly 
Mother, I will sing praise to my 
Heavenly 
Father, I will sing praise to my 
Heavenly 
Mother, I will sing praise to my 
Heavenly 
Father, I will sing praise to my 
Heavenly 
Father; 
And I will praise the 
Father, and the 
Son and the 
Holy 
Spirit, and the 
Father and we all in heaven. <endoftext

My heart will go on, my heart will go on, my heart will go on! 
My heart will go on! 
My heart will go on! 
Oh, my heart will go on!

And the stars in the sky will become as black as the sea.

================================================================================
But when I go, I will not return, 
And when I come, I will not go.

I will never cease to love my dear, dear child, and will not let go until I have given birth to her.

My heart will go on! I will keep on, and on, and on, till it gets tired, till I shall sink.

================================================================================
The air is hot and clear. 
The mountains are grey and brown. 
Snow is falling and clouds are forming.

And I will go on - 
And go on, and go on, and keep on, and go on and on, 
And I will know that my heart will always go on. 
End of story.

And if the wind blows, I will play with it, 
That I may hear it again.

================================================================================
I will not be tired of singing or playing, I will not be full of joy, and I will not be silent, because I do not want to be silent, I will write it, I will show it, I will sing it for all time, I will sing it with the best of my singing and the best of my playing.

My heart will go on, 
And my thoughts will wander on in the solitude of the field. 
And when it becomes desolate, I will mourn for some time, 
And will weep for many years, 
And then I will remember my friend's death, 
And will rejoice, 
And rejoice my friend's death, 
And I will love him and not hate him, 
And I will rejoice, 
And rejoice my friend's death, 
And I will live to see my dream fulfilled,

But I will always be happy when I am here!

================================================================================
I will not let the pain go, 
My soul will not give way, I will not let go.

My heart will go on, it goes on, I will not let go of it, I will not let go of it, 
My heart will not let go of it, 
And I will not let it go,

I will never lose my humour, I will never lose my heart, 
The humour will always go on!

================================================================================
When I hear the thunder in the mountains, I feel that my heart will go on, and it will not stop.

I will sing, I will sing, I will sing in the morning, I will sing, I will sing, I will sing, I will sing with my heart, in the morning; 
Joy 
Joy 
Joy, 
Joy 
Joy!

I have waited and waited, 
And here I am alone, 
And I tremble at my fate.

================================================================================
And how long, dear friend, when you are old! 
And how happy to hear your voice singing, 
When you are young, 
In the old age, when you are old!

And you shall go on, I will not let go. 
And that is my hope, I do not want to go, nor do I want to be without you.

The sun is bright and glorious, 
And I know that my heart will go on.

================================================================================
And the stars may shine bright, 
The evening may shine.

I know it well, the day will come when the people will listen to all the songs of the lyre, and when the sun will shine so that the dawn shall shine, 
And the flowers shall shine so that the evening shall shine so that the night shall shine, 
And when I shall sing 
The lyre to my heart, 
The day will not be long, 
The people will listen to my lyre.

I will go on, my heart will go on. 
In the night the moon will not shine, in the morning the stars will not shine. 
In the day I will not rest, in the night I will not sleep.

================================================================================
I am not able to tell you the reason why I have to write this account; but what I do know is that I fear that I have given you an account that will end in shame, and with shame I will also begin to regret the error, for the truth of the matter is, that I broke the covenant, and it will be my shame to bear the blame of my sin.

How far, how far is the unknown? 
Is there anything at all? 
And if there is, what is it? 
And if there is anything, what is it? 
So let me ask: "
Where is the unknown? - 
Whom do you seek? 
And what is it?" 
The unknown, the unknown! 
Whom do you seek? 
And what is it?" - 
Whom do you seek? 
And what is it?" - 
Whom do you seek? 
And what is it?"

On the beach, in the evening, in the morning, when I am not aware of it, I shall never go back, I shall never come back.

================================================================================
My heart will go on like that, I will not let go. 
The world is only a dream.

Now I will weep for you, my beloved, when I see you again in the kingdom of heaven. 
My heart will go on, my heart will go on.

I will live to see a thousand years. 
My heart will go on, my heart will not let go.

================================================================================
And the sky will not shine, 
And the lakes will not flow, 
And all the winds will quiet 
Down to the sea.

As if it were a garment of gold in your hand, 
That I might take possession of it. I cannot bear to think of it, 
If the garment were, 
That it were worth so much!

And my heart will go on, 
And my heart will praise the 
Lord with gladness, 
Will never rest until I have fulfilled the purpose for which I was sent; 
And I will bless him with the glory of his glorious praise.

================================================================================
Will this be the last moment of this happy existence, when we were as one? 
Will this be the last moment of this happy existence, when we were as one?

And the wind will carry me away; 
Until I hear the voices of my fathers, 
And the old voices of my fathers, 
O my heart will go on.

And with an old friend, I will go on to the other world, 
And the stars will tell me; I will not know the way, 
And I will not know my way! I will go to the other world, and you will tell me, 
And I will not know your way, 
And I wil not know my way!
