história trágico-marítima. tragic maritime history. maritime
history as history of sinking ships.
of the sadness of our short sentences at the end of october - one memory remains: a dark city forest that frightens you. further up, gentle rain penetrates into the scenery, i don't want to say the treetops. like you, the folded levberries are not the room. it remains unthoughtful. even the fading smoke does not characterize the room. the language is not the room. the room is a bench on which we hide from each other, later in the evening, when we have left this bench for a long time, it has ceased to be the room.
