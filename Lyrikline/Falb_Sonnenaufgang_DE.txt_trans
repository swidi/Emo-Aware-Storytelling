at sunrise I already felt like an innkeeper
and was from the parcel service. on the way to the receiver
no treadmill, no traces, only infections, only wear and tear.
my tourette syndrome had always communicated for me,
but now held the ceremonies.
the joke with the banana skin became substantial,
and to keep the form, I repeated it again.
t find the letterbox, or rather only the letterbox.
these offices were empty, but bugs, these were stables,
the viruses of my farm animals still in the air.
