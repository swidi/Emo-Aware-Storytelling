história trágico-marítima. tragic maritime history. 
maritime history as the history of sinking ships.
of the sadness of our brief sentences in late october – a memory remains: a honest city forest which frightens you. higher up light rain pushes into the wings, I wouldn’t like to say the tree-tops. like you the folded stocks are not the space. it remains unthought. neither does diminishing smoke designate the space. language is not the space. the space is a bench on which we hide before one another, later perhaps in the evening, when we have long since left the bench, it will again have stopped being the space.
