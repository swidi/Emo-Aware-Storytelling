N. CROSSES THE ALPS, TAIPEI
undyed pants of the
conqueror of the exotic

world, straight razor, chess
pieces he still played

with on St. Helena, now
trapped on this island.

His Chinese-sized camp
bed. Enlargement: then,

a side wing, its own
history on cloth

flowers, mini ideo
grams on egg-shell stelae

in the display with a
magnifying glass, or,

in the foyer, the emperor's
conqueror as a bronze colossus.

Rigor's stiff pauses, when
a servant of the honor

guard massages their necks,
can be unleashed,

before, with staggered
steps, the guard's relieved.

Outside, beside the pond,
a tree might well be

moving the Chi of a
man practicing: to

cross his Alps, crumb
ling into them.
