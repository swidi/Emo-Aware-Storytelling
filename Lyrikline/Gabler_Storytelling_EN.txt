ABOUT HORST JANSSEN / By Storytelling
By Storytelling
I don’t want nothing to do with Knut!
Y‘know, y‘know:

"With a head full of hormones"
you should, according to K., construct toy landscapes
or buildings in keeping with B.’s plans (B as in art) (?)

Oh, it doesn’t matter: but the goodwill disappears with that style!
The picture has to bend toward the brain,
gaping chasms, light reflexes. Of course,

of course, of course and later:
orgashas ‘em. Hasta be, y‘know: without eruption
you can’t get no plume pumped out of the mother.

So become friends with Knut?
Nah,
let’s fight a little longer instead!
