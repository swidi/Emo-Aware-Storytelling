Leaving Gomera
we let the dolphins dance
for an hour before the aquafarm
emerged, mezzo claqueurs in Agfa
Color, they tugged together on the same line and hung

the catfish in the window, it had a tendency
to boast and swagger, a vital complex
as we, semantically joined, abdicated
from the olive groves, on the yearning

motherboard, marine-sad, scaly
a raider of freshwater algae, mud baths –
in warm climes, the same line
as far as Biarritz, we Non-Butterflies

from the salines, that’s bound to sound
a bit unexpected here, I’d like
a few whiskers instead of the animal mask
then hiss, hiss, hiss

have azucar, the plunderings from the beach
they called it sand when it was simply
trickling away, watch out for missing standing strips!
when they harpooned sparrows,

magma flowed in the sky, in the reminder function
el teide, it was silted cacti, branch establishments
that must have belonged thorn-rich to the category of dry point
conifers, they tasted

like burning kernels, Asbach 68, hippies
at the periphery of the property, we waded in rubber boots
into the receiving water, the apartment complex must
have been the safe depreciation asset

we’d heard about, the wolf-fish on granite
soil or whatever that was, turning in a
repeat loop, the jingle of the water
elephants, that overnight left the supermarket
